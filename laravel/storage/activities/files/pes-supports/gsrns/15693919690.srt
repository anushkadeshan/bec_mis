1
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,480
'It's my humble appeal
that we must never forget...'

2
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,880
'...that we're Indians first,
and everything else comes later.'

3
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,960
Our differences should
be well be resolved

4
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,600
Well within the framework
of our own country.

5
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,360
'Let us all work towards
making this a reality...'

6
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:14,760
'...which may then lead to more
peace talks and negotiations...'

7
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,800
'...for establishing peace
and better relationships.'

8
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,800
'The enthusiasm and
hard work of our people...'

9
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,920
'...and their willingness to make any
sacrifice for strengthening our country.'

10
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,320
Yes, sir. How can I help?

11
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,440
Have you got an appointment?

12
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,640
No. No...

13
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,920
Ambassador.

14
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,120
Sir, you can't enter
without an appointment.

15
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,000
Ambassador...very
urgent...Meeting...

16
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,720
I told you, you are gonna have
to call and set up an appointment.

17
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,240
Russia.

18
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:17,920
K...G...B

19
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,080
What?

20
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,160
KGB.

21
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,200
He said KGB.

22
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,560
Who are you?

23
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,560
Tell me, how do we say your name?

24
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,000
Vasili Nikitich Mitrokhin

25
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,760
And how many years have
you worked for the KGB?

26
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,640
I was recruited in 1948
as a foreign intelligence officer.

27
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:00,800
I retired in 1985,
as the Director of KGB Archives.

28
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,120
Tell me, what's in these suitcases?

29
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,720
Secret documents.

30
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,880
How we assassinated the Leaders.

31
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,760
How we weakened the Economy.
Everything.

32
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,880
And how did you manage to get these
documents from the KGB Archives?

33
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,480
In his shoes.

34
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,480
How novel.

35
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,760
For 25 years, every day.

36
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,640
And tell me...

37
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,880
How many countries are in there?

38
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,360
Almost every country.

39
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,920
Interesting...

40
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,560
During the Cold War,
there was no free country.

41
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,640
They were all working
for the KGB or CIA.

42
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,440
No. Not the Land bill story.

43
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,640
I need something more meaty.

44
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,400
Like Malda or Kerala.

45
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,720
No... I need a real scoop.

46
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,800
My Editor's already called twice...

47
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,400
Hey...he's been looking for you.

48
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,680
Sir...

49
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,440
If you don't have a scoop
for me by the end of this month...

50
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,560
...I'll transfer
you to Art and Culture.

51
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,560
No. Sir,
not Art and Culture, please.

52
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,400
You know,
I enjoy Political Journalism...

53
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,240
Political Journalism demands
an investigative bent of mind.

54
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,240
- Which you don't have.
- The HRD Ministry

55
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,880
canceled my interview
at the last moment.

56
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,800
Because I am too young.

57
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,320
Nobody takes me seriously.

58
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,640
If you manufacture your
stories on fake sources...

59
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,280
...Then who will
take you seriously?

60
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,360
Huh?

61
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,000
Sir, but that story was trending.

62
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,760
It received more than a 1000
retweets and you can't deny that.

63
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,560
This is the tragedy
of the Internet age.

64
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,120
Your story was a fake.

65
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,880
Retweets is not how you
do Political Journalism, Ragini.

66
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,200
If there's any profession
more difficult than Politics...

67
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,480
...then that is
Political Journalism.

68
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,640
THIS ONE!

69
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,440
Okay. Last chance.

70
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,800
I promise I won't let you down.

71
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,360
I saved your skin last time,

72
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,040
but I can't help you this time.

73
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,840
- Sir, you have to...
- Pull up your socks...

74
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,400
...and give me a scoop.

75
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,440
- A real scoop.
- Done.

76
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,520
You have only 9 days, okay.

77
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,400
Okay.

78
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,160
Can I go?
- Yes.

79
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,920
Who cares if its Angel
Investors or Evil Investors...

80
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,600
...but I am going ahead
with my startup this year.

81
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,000
I am done with this
ethical shit, man.

82
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,320
Moralities changes
with every goddamn tweet.

83
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,960
Who wants facts?

84
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,040
Here, anything goes.

85
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,160
Hello!

86
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,960
Where's everyone? Hello.

87
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,480
"Happy birthday to you."
- Oh, God. I hate birthdays.

88
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,360
"Happy birthday dear, Ragini."

89
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,600
"Happy birthday to you."

90
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,680
"Happy birthday to you."

91
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,680
Hello.
- "Happy birthday to you."

92
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,880
Happy birthday, Ragini.

93
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,440
Thanks.
Who is speaking?

94
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,400
I have a birthday gift for you.

95
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,120
Well, I hate birthday gifts.

96
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,240
Specially from strangers.

97
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,160
Rahul, it's you, right?
I hate pranks.

98
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,320
I heard you're looking for a scoop.
- Who isn't looking for a scoop?

99
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,280
Well, I have one for you.

100
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,400
And I wanted it to be
my birthday gift to you...

101
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,960
...but, unfortunately,
you don't like birthday gifts.

102
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,960
If it's a real scoop,
then I love birthday gifts.

103
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,760
Okay Rahul, now stop it.
Enough, okay.

104
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,520
But before I give you this scoop,
let's play a game.

105
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,600
I am going to ask you
some very easy questions...

106
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,840
...and, if you answer them
correctly, the gift is all yours.

107
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:19,080
Is this Mr. Bachchan from
"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire"?

108
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,160
What kind of a game is this? I'm
not interested in playing any game.

109
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,760
You first tell me who you are.

110
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,680
Who wrote, "Jana Gana Mana"
(National Anthem)?

111
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,520
Dude, everyone knows.
Tagore.

112
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,800
Full name only, please.

113
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,520
Sorry.
Rabindranath Tagore.

114
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,800
Correct.

115
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,120
What happened on
the 26th of January?

116
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,800
Republic Day.
Okay, now stop.

117
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,200
15th August?

118
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,800
Independence Day.
- 20th August.

119
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,160
20th August...

120
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,720
Next question.
- No-no-no, wait.

121
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,360
20th August...

122
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,920
Rajiv Gandhi's birthday...?

123
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,080
5th September?
- Teacher's Day.

124
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,560
Why?
Because it's Teacher's Day.

125
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,000
No...
it's Mr. Radhakrishnan's birthday.

126
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,320
Incomplete answer.

127
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,560
Hey listen,
now you're irritating me, okay.

128
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,680
Dr. Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan,
India's 2nd President...

129
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,600
...who also translated the Gita,
and I've read it.

130
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,040
Now my gift or I am going.

131
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,000
Last question.

132
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,280
I am not going to answer
any more of your questions.

133
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,040
First you tell me who you are.

134
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,480
2nd October.

135
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,120
Who is this?

136
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,280
What happened on
the 2nd of October?

137
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,120
Mahatma Gandhi... now get lost.

138
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,880
Hello...?

139
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,600
Hello, you there?

140
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,120
Hello.

141
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,760
I am waiting for you
to complete your answer.

142
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,760
But I just answered your question.

143
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:50,480
Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi,
Mahatma, Bapu, Father of the Nation...

144
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,840
...what else do I call him?

145
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,560
That's an incomplete answer,
Ragini.

146
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,400
I am sorry but you lost the game.

147
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,040
What else is on the 2nd of October?
Dry Day?

148
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,160
2nd October.

149
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,080
Ohh... Shit...
Wait-wait-wait...

150
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,800
It's also Shashtri's birthday.

151
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,600
Shashtri?

152
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,640
Lal Bahadur Shashtri,
India's 2nd Prime Minister.

153
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,920
And when did he die?

154
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,360
I don't know.

155
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,280
All I know is that
he died in Tashkent?

156
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,040
Yeah... Tashkent.

157
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,440
How?

158
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,840
I seriously don't know.

159
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,920
Who is this?

160
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,000
Congratulations Ragini,
you passed the test.

161
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,280
What kind of a
stupid game was this?

162
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,480
You'll find a yellow
packet in your drawer.

163
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,720
No-no-no, don't hang up.

164
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,920
Ragini, that's your birthday gift.
The scoop.

165
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:11,160
"10th January 1966..."
"A Historical Day."

166
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,600
"After the Indo-Pak war in 1965..."

167
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:19,120
"...and India's historic win,
there was a convention held in Tashkent."

168
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,840
"The Tashkent Agreement."

169
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:25,480
"The USSR Premiere Alexi Kosygin,
Pakistan's President Ayub Khan..."

170
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:31,240
"...and India's 2nd Prime Minister,
Mr. Lal Bahdur Shashtri met in Tashkent.'

171
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:39,200
"After 6 rigorous days, the Tashkent
Pact was signed on 10th January 1966"

172
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,120
"A party was organized
in the evening..."

173
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:48,680
"...and Mr. Shashtri was last
seen pacing around in his room."

174
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,320
"A few hours later
Mr. Shashtri died unexpectedly."

175
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,480
"And even after 50 long years...

176
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,360
...we still don't know whether
he died of a heart attack..."

177
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,240
"...or whether was he poisoned."

178
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,120
"I filed a second application..."

179
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,200
"...and this time it was
against the Foreign Ministry."

180
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,400
"I telling them that I had
already filed an application..."

181
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,960
"...and you replied saying
that the Foreign Ministry...

182
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,040
...still doesn't have
any confirmation..."

183
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,920
"...to which I replied
how is this even possible?"

184
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,160
"The man who died was the
Prime Minister of a country..."

185
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,000
"...I am sure the Ambassador
must be going nuts."

186
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,840
"As soon as the news
of the Prime Minister's death..."

187
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,120
"would've broken out the phones wouldn't
have stopped ringing off the hook."

188
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,800
"Telegrams sent all across..."

189
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,760
"There must be a plethora of paper
trail between Moscow and Delhi."

190
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,880
"You'll be flying the Prime
Minister's body from there to here..."

191
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,240
"...and what system
are they going to follow?

192
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,200
What will be the arrangements?"

193
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,640
"And all these points
have to be documented."

194
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,880
"How can you say that you
have no supporting documents ?"

195
00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:00,880
"That's when they said that under the
RTI Clause of the National Security..."

196
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,720
"...we cannot disclose
this information to you."

197
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,720
Ragini.

198
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,560
What is all this?

199
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,160
Lal Bahadur Shashtri's
mysterious death.

200
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,200
All this information relating to his
death is available in the public domain.

201
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,200
It runs over 5000 pages.

202
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,080
But what does our government have
relating to Mr. Shashtri's death?

203
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,920
Just this.

204
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,400
Nothing.

205
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,880
Lal Bahadur Shashtri?
- Yeah...

206
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,920
Our generation is
least interested in him.

207
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,720
It's not about Shashtri,
let's pin down the government.

208
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,040
Lal Bahadur Shashtri was the 2nd
Prime Minister of independent India...

209
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,800
...who died in Tashkent.

210
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,560
When?
Immediately after the war.

211
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,160
Thousands of suspicious,
and doubts were raised.

212
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,480
Some claimed that he was poisoned,
some said he had a heart attack.

213
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,560
But over 50 years do
we have concrete information?

214
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,160
No. Nothing.

215
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,160
There's no proof to corroborate
that he was poisoned.

216
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,600
Who cares?

217
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,680
Okay, sorry. But we need a scoop,
and we have a scoop.

218
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:09,000
And sir, this time I've
brought authentic paperwork...

219
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,600
...with the seal of
the Government of India.

220
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:16,160
As supporting evidence, I have Anuj
That's RTIs and also his statement.

221
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,880
I've already run it with legal,
and they said it's okay.

222
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,680
No media.

223
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,520
Aditya Raj invited Home Minister PKR..
- I said no media.

224
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,480
...Natrajan for a meeting over
the questions... - I said no media.

225
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,640
...raised on Lal Bahadur Shashtri case.
- I said no media.

226
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,000
We can't say much
about closed rooms...

227
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,720
...but we're definitely going
to debate over this issue today.

228
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,040
Stop them.

229
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,600
Did Shashtri die
or was he murdered?

230
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,240
This question is a slap
on the face of our country...

231
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:06,560
...which no government over the last
50 years has tried to find an answer to.

232
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,240
What is the government
trying to hide from us?

233
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,000
What conspiracy lurks behind Mr.
Shashtri's death?

234
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,520
We're going to organize a
nationwide protest to find answers.

235
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,960
Yes! Yes We Will!

236
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:26,720
We won't rest or, neither
let anyone rest.

237
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,240
Mr. Shashtri gave us the slogan...

238
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,920
...of "Jai Jawan, Jai Kishan" (Hail
the soldier, Hail the farmer).

239
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,200
But what is the slogan
of this government?

240
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,120
"Hail Satan, Hail Evil?"

241
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,320
Mr. Shashtri's files
should be made public.

242
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,680
"Yes, we demand
they are made public!"

243
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,960
- Mr. Shashtri's files...
- Must be reopened...!

244
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,600
- Mr. Shashtri's files...
- Must be reopened...!

245
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,680
27th May, 1964.

246
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,080
After the death of Pt. Nehru...

247
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,960
...the president of Congress,
and Syndicate leader

248
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,360
K. Kamaraj became active again.

249
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,120
And he was facing the
responsibility...

250
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,520
...of choosing the next
leader of our country.

251
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,720
And the breaking
news of the hour...

252
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,040
...is that opposition leader
Mr. Shyamsunder Tripathi

253
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,480
will be going on a hunger strike.

254
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,120
How can you expect
anything to change

255
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,360
if the leaders of our country
go on a hunger strike?

256
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,560
You need to rest.

257
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,920
When I'll have no power, there's not
much that blood pressure can do.

258
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,760
Sit. Sit.

259
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:27,160
How did Mr. Shashtri
become the PM after Pt. Nehru?

260
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,480
He wasn't even a candidate

261
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,360
Morarji Desai was
the most senior...

262
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,920
...and a deserving
candidate for PM.

263
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,280
So who was the kingmaker there?

264
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,400
Kamaraj, remember?

265
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,040
No. I don't know.

266
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,040
Kumaraswamy Kamraj.

267
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,080
And after Mr. Shashtri's death,
Morarji Desai should have been

268
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,440
the next PM.

269
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,760
But it was Indra Gandhi instead.

270
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,880
Kamaraj again.

271
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,280
Everyone remembers the Kings.

272
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,960
Not the kingmakers.

273
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,800
'Mr Shastri's agenda
has taken a new turn.'

274
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,920
'What's the agenda
of Minister Natarajan'

275
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,640
'and Shyam Sunder Tripathi's
meeting?'

276
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,720
'Is it finding the truth
behind Lal Bahadur Shastri's death'

277
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,600
'or to reach some sort
of agreement?'

278
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,080
It's all rather rich.

279
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,360
Just a little...

280
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,960
Here you go...
- No-no...fried objects are...

281
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:44,000
Mr. Natrajan, it's made
in pure ghee, with potatoes.

282
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,640
It won't even make a dent.

283
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,880
Well, if you insist...
Thank you.

284
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,480
I am curious...

285
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,880
What's your benefit
in forming a committee?

286
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:58,400
Because you know very well
that I cannot be influenced.

287
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,520
There are only two
copies of this report.

288
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,480
One in Justice Shah's office,
and the other one...is this.

289
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,240
The final report will only be drafted
when my Ministry issues a statement.

290
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:32,840
So the disciple wants to
blackmail his mentor.

291
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,200
Is that a yes?

292
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,960
Hear that?

293
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,920
I'm not the only one in this mess,
you are too.

294
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,680
You cannot budge
without my approval.

295
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,040
This committee will have 8 members.

296
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,720
Four from each side.

297
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,240
And of course,
you with the Veto power.

298
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:14,160
You've pretty good experience
on how to handle those 8 members.

299
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,720
Oh yes...

300
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,760
There will be no media
coverage or video recording.

301
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,240
What a dilemma...

302
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,120
We're doing everything for Mr.
Shashtri...

303
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,040
...but no one's talking about him.

304
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,240
What was the name
of that journalist?

305
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,800
Hi...

306
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,240
Good morning...
- Good morning.

307
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,320
Good morning...
- Good morning.

308
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,520
Mr. Tripathi...

309
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,520
Mr. Tripathi...

310
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,200
Ohh...

311
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,720
Well, you're pretty young.

312
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,520
Come, sit.

313
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,640
You may have guessed
why I called you over.

314
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:07,680
If a politician sends flowers to a
journalist and invites her over...

315
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,360
...then it's definitely
something big.

316
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,880
You're more mature than you look.

317
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,480
Nevertheless,
let's get to the point.

318
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,960
How would you like to do it?

319
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,440
Cash? Favor? Or both?

320
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,160
Depends.
What's the offer?

321
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,600
Why are you so interested
in Mr. Shashtri?

322
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,080
I am only interested in the truth.

323
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,520
In Politics,
nothing is what it seems.

324
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,320
And that's the truth.

325
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,600
Well sir, if you want that
I don't write anything related to

326
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,440
Lal Bahadur Shastri's death...

327
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,640
...then let me tell you that...

328
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,280
I...am...

329
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,880
...proposing your name.

330
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,680
My name?

331
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,600
It's absolutely crucial for
a journalist to be on the committee...

332
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:05,200
...and you've done extensive
research on this subject.

333
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:11,720
You're young,
intelligent, and a woman at that.

334
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,720
Here...

335
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,120
What's the real motive?

336
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:25,760
You know,
Natrajan believes in cameras.

337
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:33,320
Whereas I respect the
human eye and intelligence.

338
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,720
And you have both.

339
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:42,960
I want you to be my
camera in the committee.

340
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,720
Meaning you're more concerned
about your image in the media.

341
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:56,520
It's the only thing
a politician has.

342
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,080
Politics is a battlefield.

343
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,520
People are not
interested in the truth...

344
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,800
...only the stories of truth.

345
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:12,720
Sir...I am an amateur journalist,
and your ambitions are too big for me.

346
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,400
Journalism is yet another
name for Politics.

347
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,800
I heard that you're looking
for funding for your news site.

348
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,480
Did Lal Bahadur Shashtri
die of a heart attack...

349
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,800
...or was it a conspiracy?

350
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,200
The Tripathi Committee
will conduct an investigation.

351
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,400
And the head of this committee
is Mr. Shyam Sunder Tripathi.

352
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,760
Would you like to shed some more
light on the Tripathi Committee?

353
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,920
Sir...Sir...

354
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,560
Ex-RAW Chief...GKF Anand Suresh.

355
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,480
That's Ananthsuresh with an 'H'.

356
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,720
One word.

357
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,840
Sorry, sir.

358
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,840
The youth leader of the ruling
party, Mr. Vishvendra Pratap Singh.

359
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,960
...is this committee just
an excuse to bury this question?

360
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,280
So you don't trust the RAW.

361
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,680
Sir...Sir...

362
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,800
Ex-Judge of Supreme Court,
Retired Justice Kurien Abraham.

363
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,480
Sir, do you think
that Mr Shasti was poisoned?'

364
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,320
Ma'am, I'll open the doors
in the next couple of minutes.

365
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,440
Thank you.

366
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,640
Do you have a matchstick?

367
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,800
Yes, ma'am.

368
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,040
Thank you.

369
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,920
The Director of Archives India, Mr.
Omkar Kashyap as well.

370
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,600
Renowned Social Worker,
who also runs many NGOs...

371
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,680
...and a strong opposer of
the government, Indira Joseph Roy.

372
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,520
Of course...

373
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,840
How can anything go
wrong as long as I am here.

374
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:57,040
The Director of Indian Research
Council, Mr. Gangaram Jha.

375
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:01,760
Renowned Historian and an expert
on Mr. Shashtri, Padmashri Ayesha Ali.

376
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,520
The most controversial selection,

377
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:08,960
which is said to be
a last minute decision.

378
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,240
What do you think you're doing?
Turn it off.

379
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,760
Aren't their heaters in the room?

380
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,840
They don't work. I've already
informed Maintenance crew.

381
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,440
That settles it then.

382
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,960
Let things continue
the way they are.

383
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,720
Sir, ma'am, please deposit
your mobile phones with me.

384
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,800
Mobile phones are
not allowed in here.

385
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,960
Where?

386
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,800
There.

387
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,880
Do you know for a fact, Ms.
Ayesha, that...

388
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,320
I am a historian,
and I know more than you think.

389
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,400
Oh,
Hello.

390
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,400
Oh, shit.

391
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,400
Yeah... shit.

392
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,760
Thank you.

393
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,080
Cigarette?

394
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,120
No thanks, Kashyap.

395
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,360
Why? I know for a fact that
everyone in RAW smokes.

396
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,360
Smoking is not allowed.

397
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,240
Yeah, I know.

398
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,760
Smoking is not allowed.
- Thank you.

399
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,400
God bless.

400
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,520
Excuse me,
are phones allowed in here?

401
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,800
I'll deposit it.

402
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,640
Because I still don't
use a mobile phone.

403
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,800
By the way, I am The Omkar Kashyap.
Retired Director, Archives.

404
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,800
Okay.
Hello, I am Ragini Phule.

405
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,320
So you're the reason
why we all gathered here.

406
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,480
Good morning everybody.

407
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,600
Good morning, Mr. Shyam.
- Good morning...

408
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,680
Take a seat everyone.

409
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,800
Omkar Kashyap.
Omkar Kashyap.

410
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,720
Okay...

411
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,320
Someone's missing.

412
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,720
The quorum is complete,
we can start the meeting.

413
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,720
Is the quorum complete?
- Yes, sir.

414
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,280
Sorry-Sorry-Sorry...

415
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,640
My flight took off late from Bombay.
- Mumbai.

416
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:09,320
Yeah, I know Mumbai...for me,
it will always remain Bombay.

417
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,040
I can't even pronounce
Delhi for that matter.

418
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,800
Actually, I had a keynote address
at the World Science Congress.

419
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:21,320
The relevance of Common Sense in
the Age of Artificial Intelligence.

420
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:25,440
But we've gathered here
today to talk about Mr. Shashtri.

421
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,440
Oh...

422
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,880
Sir...
Sir...

423
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,400
Hello.

424
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,520
You may begin the discussion...

425
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,800
...because it will come to
a conclusion on its own.

426
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,400
And why do you say that?

427
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,720
Sir, rumors.

428
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,360
And what is the
lifespan of a rumor?

429
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,840
Rumors.
- Yes.

430
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,640
You mean this committee
was formed on the basis of rumors.

431
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,880
That's your opinion.

432
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,960
Sir, we cannot ignore common sense.

433
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,920
I believe we'll reach
a decision by lunchtime.

434
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,840
Then we can all go
down to North Block...

435
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,560
...and have some South Indian food.

436
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,120
You seem to be in a bit of a hurry.

437
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,200
Have you made reservations as well?

438
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,520
No, no, I've studied the case.

439
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,240
It's quite simple.
There's nothing to it.

440
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,000
No documents, no proof, no logic.
Wastage of public money.

441
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,800
It's as simple as ABCD.

442
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,080
I don't think it's
as simple as ABCD.

443
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:18,440
Unless of course, maybe
you know something that we don't.

444
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,200
For example...ABCD.

445
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,720
Please...

446
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,080
The Agenda is on
everyone's monitor.

447
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,520
Information and Facts.

448
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,160
Go through them.

449
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,920
We'll focus on every aspect.

450
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,680
Hear the witness.

451
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:39,520
And if anyone has a
witness who has more information...

452
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,040
...then you can recommend
their names as well.

453
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,000
But sir, the registration
for witnesses have already closed.

454
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:49,000
I have extraordinary powers, son.

455
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,960
If we believe that he
has some unique information...

456
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,880
...then we won't just admit it,
but also summon them.

457
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,360
But only if we have a majority.

458
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,920
We won't waste our time on hearsay.

459
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,680
Those of us who think
that Mr. Shashtri's death

460
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,520
was a natural one, meaning
he died of a heart attack...

461
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,480
...please raise your hand.

462
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:28,280
Mr. Roy.
Why did you lower your hand?

463
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,520
Mr. Vishvendra, when there
are so many suspicions

464
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,520
revolving around the
death of a Prime Minister...

465
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:37,080
...then don't you feel there
should be some debate over it.

466
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:40,120
By the way, this committee's been
formed to investigate his death...

467
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:44,360
...but let's talk about
his personal life first.

468
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,040
He was only 16 years old, you know.

469
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:52,760
At the age of 16, he took part
in Gandhiji's Satyagraha movement.

470
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,880
And before that,
when he was only 12...

471
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:02,920
...he stopped using Shrivastav,
which was his family name because

472
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,600
he was strongly against
the caste system.

473
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,240
Post his marriage, he asked
his wife Lalita to wear Khadi...

474
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,680
...and his wife complied
without any objection.

475
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,760
He was a true Gandhian.

476
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:17,880
And at the time of his death,
he had only one car...

477
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,240
...which he bought with
a government-sanctioned loan.

478
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,520
And yes, not to forget
that he defeated Pakistan.

479
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,320
What does that prove?

480
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,400
When did I say it proves anything?

481
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,840
I remember...

482
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,120
I was 20-year-old...

483
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,760
During the war,

484
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,400
Mr. Shashtri would
visit the borders,

485
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,440
meet with the soldiers.

486
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:43,480
"If someone tries to
threaten the sanctity of

487
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,200
our country using guns or bombs..."

488
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:51,240
"...then as your leader,
our best reply would be that

489
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,000
we fight the enemy
using their own weapon."

490
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:59,280
It's a known fact that
good people die early.

491
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,320
By the way,
he was an old man when he died. 62

492
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,600
61...
He was 61.

493
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,360
Okay.
But people have died at 58, right?

494
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,240
Ronald Reagan was 69
when he became President.

495
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,320
Absolutely.

496
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,320
And our Prime Minister Mr.
Morarji Desai...

497
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,560
became the Prime Minister
at the age of 81.

498
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,840
Age is just numbers.

499
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:23,280
But Shashtri was a great man,
brave man.

500
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,040
All these discussions
are irrelevant.

501
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,280
Prime Minister was a brave man...

502
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:31,000
...but that doesn't mean
that he had a strong heart too.

503
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:34,280
If we can access
his medical records,

504
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:38,120
ECG, BP records from
before 11th January...

505
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,440
But all that is normally
recorded in the Doctor's diary...

506
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,960
...which the government
doesn't have.

507
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,280
oh, please...
- What please, Ananth?

508
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,960
But it's a fact that

509
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,960
Mr. Shashtri suffered
a heart attack prior to this.

510
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,960
Twice, sir. Twice.

511
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,840
Case closed,
let's go get something to eat.

512
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,320
Isn't it true that the hotel
Where he was supposed to stay...

513
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:02,000
...was changed at the last moment

514
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,840
and was asked to stay
at a 'Dancha' instead.

515
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,240
The word 'Dancha' is
Russian for a bungalow.

516
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,000
Professor, case reopened.

517
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,360
The fact is that for
the Prime Minister's stay...

518
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:18,200
...a DIG from the Central Government had
flown to Tashkent to approve of it.

519
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,640
The hotel had a stairway...

520
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,120
Bad for a heart patient.

521
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,040
But there were
none in the 'Dancha'.

522
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,040
Hence 'Dancha'.

523
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:31,160
According to what I had read,
what the DIG had approved...

524
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:34,560
...was not a Dancha,
but an in-tourist hotel instead.

525
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,680
I repeat... in-tourist hotel.

526
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,480
With a provision of
a makeshift operation theatre

527
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,600
and oxygen in its ground floor.

528
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,560
Exactly two days earlier, due
to the intervention of a doctor and

529
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:48,160
a high-ranking
officer from Moscow...

530
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:53,520
...the PM's stay was shifted from
the hotel and moved to this Dancha.

531
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:59,000
And his staff was put up
11 kilometers away from the site.

532
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,520
Excuse me.

533
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,640
250 yards.

534
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,080
Not 11 kilometers, sir.

535
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,920
There was no operation
theatre or oxygen in that Dancha.

536
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,480
Isn't that true?
- Unbelievable.

537
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,400
A Prime Minister
who is a heart patient...

538
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,240
...and has already
suffered two heart attacks,

539
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,920
has no oxygen tank in his room.

540
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,280
There is something called
as an official protocol.

541
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:23,200
Sir, please,
with your permission...

542
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,800
...I would just like
to read out the facts.

543
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,800
After his return from
reception to the residence...

544
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,600
...Lal Bahadur Shashtri
was in normal health,

545
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,880
and was in a good mood...

546
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,840
...and spoke over the telephone
with his relatives in Delhi.

547
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,880
He went to bed at
about 12:30 midnight,

548
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,480
on the 11th of January.
At about 1:20 in the morning...

549
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:46,360
...Mr. Sahai, Kapoor, and Sharma
approached the Prime Minister's doctor...

550
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,280
...who was in the room next to him

551
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,880
and told him that the
Prime Minister was feeling unwell.

552
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,160
Dr. Chug at once approached
the Prime Minister

553
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,800
who was sitting
on his bed coughing...

554
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,920
...and was complaining
of lack of breath.

555
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,920
The doctor put the Prime
Minister in a reclining position...

556
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,400
...and gave him an
intra-muscular injection.

557
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,560
Within the next three minutes,

558
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,920
Prime Minister Shashtri
lost consciousness,

559
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,360
pulse disappeared...

560
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,200
...breathing stopped and
heartbeats could not be heard.

561
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,600
The death occurred at 1:32 in
the morning of 11th January, 1966.

562
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,400
After which 6 more doctors
arrived on the spot...

563
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:27,960
...followed by a lady doctor
by the name of Yerenko.

564
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,360
Yeremenko, sir.

565
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,800
Right, Yeremenko.

566
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,600
They all arrived on the scene,
examined the patient...

567
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,080
...and declared that Mr.
Shashtri was no longer breathing.

568
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,640
Back then two reports were made.

569
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,240
One report was handed
to the Indian Government.

570
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:47,600
And the other,
to the existing Soviet government

571
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:50,520
There is one fact
which we all are missing.

572
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,440
How can we miss anything
as long as you're here, Ms. Indira?

573
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:57,880
A very important point which
even...historians missed out on.

574
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:02,880
Mr. Shashtri's room...had no bell.

575
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,880
No buzzer.
- No bell...no buzzer.

576
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,720
What?
- Wait a minute.

577
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:11,120
My common sense is saying
that there's something wrong here.

578
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,400
There is no problem. There
is no problem. There is no problem.

579
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,080
All of you have a copy
of the reports, correct?

580
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,280
Please check your medical records.

581
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,760
Every doctor has cited.
Where is the argument?

582
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,680
This report contains signatures of
6 doctors excluding Dr. R.N. Chug.

583
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,600
But there were
a total of 8 doctors.

584
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,360
Sir...
- Yes...

585
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,680
Sir, everyone's
signatures are right here...

586
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,240
...but the Home Minister and Foreign
Minister admitted in the Parliament...

587
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:46,520
...that Senior Dr. E.G. Yeremenko
arrived on the spot first.

588
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,160
Then why isn't her
signature on the document?

589
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,640
Is it possible that
she refused to sign?

590
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,960
Maybe because she had a doubt.

591
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,640
Why are you asking
stupid questions?

592
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,280
Sir, I think she
is on the committee,

593
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,080
she should be allowed
to make her point.

594
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:00,560
Sir, point no. 2 is why wasn't Mr.
Shashtri given oxygen.

595
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,000
There's no mention of oxygen.

596
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,280
It's written in the report.

597
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,560
The report clearly mentions
that he was given oxygen.

598
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,360
No, ma'am. Excuse me, sir.

599
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:11,800
It states here that he was administered
an intramuscular injection,

600
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,440
artificial respiration,
and massage.

601
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:17,280
But there's no mention
of an intubular oxygen...

602
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,800
...which is compulsory
for a heart patient

603
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,520
who has already suffered
two heart attacks.

604
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:26,120
Maybe he wasn't given
oxygen because there was none...

605
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,400
Sir, sir, just a minute.

606
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,920
How could I not see this?
Common sense.

607
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
It says here Mr. Shashtri

608
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:36,560
was administered Intramuscular
injection Mefthantine sulfate 15mg...

609
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:40,560
...whereas his heart had already stopped
beating and blood pressure was nil.

610
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,800
In such conditions doctors
give intra-venus injections.

611
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:48,400
In layman's term, the injection
is administered in the veins...

612
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,040
...so that the medicine reaches
the system immediately

613
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,160
and starts showing effects.

614
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:55,600
Whereas, Mr. Shashtri was
given an intramuscular injection.

615
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,160
So that the medicine
reaches the system late.

616
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,760
May I ask?

617
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:03,600
Did the doctor not know such
a common thing in medical science?

618
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,640
Or was it intentional?

619
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,480
Could it be possible that
Mr. Shashtri was already dead

620
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,520
and the injection
was administered later?

621
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,920
And that's why
Dr. E.G. Yeremenko refused to sign.

622
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,280
Sir, one should have some prima facia
evidence to support this hypothesis.

623
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:21,800
Right. - Maybe evidence
was made to disappear.

624
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,640
Or burnt, what else.

625
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,960
No, no, no, I take strong
objection to this, sir.

626
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,400
Of course, you do.

627
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:31,600
By the way, Mr. Vishvendra, we
all know your history pretty well.

628
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,320
Oh, madam,
we all know your history as well...

629
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,560
...but let's not get
into that right now. Please.

630
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,280
This is your problem.
This is your problem...

631
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,560
It's an old habit of yours.

632
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,000
Taking things off records.

633
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,800
Which is why we don't
have proper records.

634
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,560
What do you mean by us?

635
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:53,040
Politicians.
They have ruined this country.

636
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,240
Objection.

637
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,440
I take objection on this statement.

638
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,800
Even I am a politician.

639
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,560
By the way, even your
father-in-law was in politics.

640
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,720
From her first marriage.

641
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,080
No, no, no...

642
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,520
That is misogynistic.

643
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,800
No, no, no...

644
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,240
That is misogynistic.

645
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,960
I take offense to that.

646
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,080
It's not allowed.

647
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,600
I will say what I want to say.

648
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,000
That is the point.

649
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,480
No, I don't care.

650
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,400
Congratulations, Ragini

651
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,240
You've already become a celebrity.

652
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,520
Come on, sir.

653
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:54,200
Zee News called for
a Prime Time Talk show.

654
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:58,080
They want to invite you, not me.

655
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,840
For the Prime Time Talk show.

656
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:06,240
I fought for you, for this article.

657
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,120
Risked my job.

658
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,480
Thank you very much.

659
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,160
Okay guys, let's roll.

660
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:22,320
5...4...3...2...1... Go.

661
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,200
Hello. Ragini,
this issue was long forgotten.

662
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,040
All the debates have been done.

663
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,480
So why dig up old graves now?

664
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,000
Old graves...

665
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,200
Asking questions about the
death of the 2nd Prime Minister

666
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,840
of Independent India,
Mr. Lal Bahadur Shashtri...

667
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:46,280
...and demanding the truth
is digging up old graves for you?

668
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,680
Not for me.

669
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,160
Do you believe you're
the messiah of truth?

670
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,600
Bloody TV reporter.

671
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,800
Is it true that
you had only a week...

672
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,200
...and since it's impossible to do
an investigative story in a week...

673
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,640
...you got desperate.

674
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,840
And to save your job,
you just went on Google,

675
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,320
searched conspiracy theories...

676
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,880
That's called research.
It's my job...

677
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,880
And you found a new story.
This is called fake news.

678
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,160
Answer me, why did you do this?

679
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,000
Why did you do this?

680
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,320
Tell me.

681
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,480
Ragini, why did you do this?
What do you want?

682
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,040
I just want the
truth to be out there.

683
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,920
Don't we have any
right to the truth?

684
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,840
Stop this truth.

685
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:36,200
Huh Kaiser,
what is this stupid girl thinking?

686
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,840
That we're afraid of the truth.

687
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:44,040
Only idiots are
afraid of the truth.

688
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,480
One should be afraid of rumours.

689
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,440
Rumours.

690
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,120
Because if rumours
are not stopped in time...

691
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:55,280
...then it can even defy the truth.

692
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,600
What is this cover-up?

693
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,120
Don't we have a right
to know the truth?

694
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,640
We want to know what
happened with Mr. Shashtri.

695
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,120
Was it a heart attack, or was it...

696
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,560
Or was it a state sponsored murder.

697
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,360
What is this girl's agenda?

698
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,920
Hello, Mr. Unknown Caller.

699
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:39,440
Congrats, Ragini. Congrats.

700
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,200
Thank you.

701
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,000
The interview was sensational.
- Thank you.

702
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,560
Demanding for a committee
was a real trump card.

703
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,000
Now you are a star journalist.

704
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,680
No, I am not a star journalist.

705
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:52,880
I am a nobody.

706
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,800
But I want to meet you,
and I want to thank you.

707
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:58,240
Whoever you are,
sir, I want to meet you.

708
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:00,560
Nobody?

709
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,360
Then why are all eyes on you?

710
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:04,040
All eyes are on me?

711
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,560
Look outside.

712
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:09,600
Outside?

713
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,000
Outside...

714
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,280
from the balcony.

715
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,520
How do you know someone's
outside my house.

716
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,120
Hello. Am I being watched?

717
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:44,080
Am I under surveillance. Tell me.

718
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:45,520
Who is watching me?

719
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:46,800
Are there cameras in my house?

720
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,000
Tell me goddamnit.
I know how this works.

721
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,160
I know...

722
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:52,120
Talk to me.

723
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,520
If you're real then show yourself.

724
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,720
Ragini, you just passed
level two of this game.

725
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:59,240
To hell with your game!

726
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,200
Ragini,

727
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:13,120
do you know any cricket star...

728
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,800
...who retired after
making a single century

729
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,760
because he was scared
of facing bouncers?

730
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:20,600
Or a film star,
who rejected a role.

731
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:24,640
Did you come all the way to Delhi
from Pune to score a single century?

732
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:28,800
99 is not a century, Ragini.

733
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:30,480
This is a war.

734
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,320
And you cannot stop
after a single victory.

735
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,040
Who are you?

736
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:37,080
Your source.

737
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,640
You can't be just source.

738
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:42,680
What do you know?

739
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,360
Why are you after me?

740
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:52,680
Why me?
- Because I want you to win, Ragini.

741
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,600
Because no one pays heed to losers.

742
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:59,200
Have a good night, Ragini.

743
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,280
I wish you all the best, Ragini.

744
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,120
"Day after day..."

745
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:20,880
"...my hopes die with me."

746
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:26,640
"Missing..."

747
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:31,400
"...is my conscience inside me."

748
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:37,120
"And what about the God..."

749
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:42,200
"...that's supposed
to alleviate our sorrows."

750
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,640
"Why are humans still losing."

751
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:50,040
"My self-respect is gone.
I keep on falling."

752
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:53,880
"I am at loss of words."

753
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:57,840
"I am at loss of words."

754
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:02,880
"Everything goes."

755
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:07,440
"Everything goes."

756
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:12,000
"Everything goes."

757
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:16,000
"Everything goes."

758
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:19,920
"Everything goes."

759
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:25,000
"Everything goes."

760
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:43,240
It's true that Mr. Shashtri's
medical reports were buried.

761
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:46,600
Is it also true that

762
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:50,320
one of the medical doctors
refused to sign on that report?

763
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,760
That's what my ex-boss told me.

764
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:55,600
Who ex-boss?

765
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,480
The great editor Bakshi, sir.

766
00:48:58,120 --> 00:48:59,200
Bakshi...

767
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:02,280
I want to meet him. Where is he?

768
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:06,120
God knows where Bakshi sir is.
- Why?

769
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,040
He just vanished. Disappeared.

770
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:15,080
But sir, there must be some lead.
Something.

771
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:17,440
I want to crack this.
Please help me out.

772
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:24,360
He had an entire file on
Mr. Shashtri's medical report.

773
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:25,920
Yeah...

774
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,920
Given to him by an Indian spy.

775
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:29,600
Spy?

776
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:37,480
That he was a KGB mole.

777
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,280
And KGB claimed that
he was a RAW mole.

778
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,040
Here...

779
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:47,400
And he died in a cylinder
blast in one of Moscow's factories.

780
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:48,840
Disclaimed.

781
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:53,680
And then, two years ago
someone spotted him in Tashkent.

782
00:49:58,440 --> 00:49:59,560
Mukhtar.

783
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:01,960
Yes. This will help.

784
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:07,640
Thank you so much, sir.

785
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:09,800
You've been a great support.

786
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:13,520
Ragini...

787
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:16,920
I don't know how to do this.

788
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:21,720
The Management thinks
that you should resign.

789
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:26,000
I am there whenever you need help.

790
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:39,800
"Everyone's fallen asleep."

791
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:41,400
"Some are awake."

792
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:44,680
"Everyone has a reason..."
"It's all unreasonable."

793
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:49,360
"Everything goes."

794
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:56,160
"Everything goes."

795
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:02,480
"Everything goes."

796
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:06,520
Something definitely
happened with you.

797
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,080
What happened on 10th January?

798
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:15,720
What is the truth?

799
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:18,200
Please help me out.

800
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:21,040
Please...

801
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:26,520
"Whose blood has
frozen in his veins."

802
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:29,800
"Everyone has a reason..."
"It's all unreasonable."

803
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:31,480
Hello.

804
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:34,680
"Everything goes."

805
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:39,920
"Everything goes."

806
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:41,200
Akbar?

807
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,640
I am doing a research
on Lal Bahadur Shashtri.

808
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:48,120
Do you recognise this man?

809
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:51,880
Akbar!

810
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:53,800
Akbar!

811
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:34,480
Who are you?

812
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:38,360
What do you know about
Lal Bahadur Shashtri's death?

813
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,680
Who do you work for?

814
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:46,640
The truth.

815
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:48,920
Don't try to sound naive.

816
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:52,280
Do you know who you're up against?

817
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,560
These are International
secret agents.

818
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,000
You'll disappear from the face
of earth before you even realize...

819
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:00,520
Forever.

820
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:04,240
Save your life and run.

821
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:05,440
Run!

822
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,040
Was it CIA?

823
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,760
Then why did you burn
yourself twice, Mukhtar?

824
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:20,520
What do you know that you're
always on the run, always hiding.

825
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,680
This was during the Cold War.

826
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,680
America was spreading Democracy and
Capitalism all over the world...

827
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:32,920
...and USSR was spreading
socialism and communism.

828
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:34,760
See...

829
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:36,360
This is the Iron Curtain.

830
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,480
All the countries on this
side were allies with the US.

831
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,880
And the countries on
this side were with the USSR.

832
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:45,520
And this Cold War was
not between some armies...

833
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:48,080
...it was being run
by two secret agencies.

834
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,800
CIA and KGB.

835
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:53,520
1970s.

836
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:55,400
It was the era of spies.

837
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:59,200
And India was the most important
country for both of them.

838
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:03,120
The CIA's philosophy was if
you want to enslave any country...

839
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,720
...then just buy them with money.

840
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:08,920
But the KGB believed that
if you control people's mind,

841
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:11,240
then they will become your slave.

842
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,200
But this was not possible
as long as Mr. Shashtri was alive.

843
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:20,120
So what is the truth about Mr.
Shashtri?

844
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:22,640
Truth.

845
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:27,640
When I joined the secret agency,

846
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:29,760
I learned the most interesting art.

847
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:32,040
The art...of disappearing.

848
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:34,760
People...

849
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:37,400
Items...

850
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:39,920
Documents...

851
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,000
just like that.

852
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:44,760
See...

853
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,880
And...even the truth.

854
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:03,920
Opponents, intellectuals, leaders,

855
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:07,280
witnesses,
whistle-blowers, professors.

856
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:09,480
I made them disappear
at the blink of an eye.

857
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:14,400
Riots, assassinations,
coos, unrest, everything.

858
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:20,480
Documents, governments,
facts, figures, spies, truth...

859
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:24,560
All that was a cinch for me.

860
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:28,760
I thought I was God.

861
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:33,920
We are nothing.

862
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:35,200
Nothing...

863
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:38,640
Someone else is
pulling the strings.

864
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:41,600
Who?

865
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:44,920
You can't see him.

866
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:48,360
He has no whereabouts.

867
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:52,280
But we all dance to his tunes.

868
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:53,720
Almost like a God.

869
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:56,280
What do you think?

870
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:03,040
When people like me couldn't
find him, someone like you can.

871
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:07,320
I am not a coward like you.

872
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:15,080
Have you ever heard that
two medical reports were made for

873
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:16,440
the same dead person.

874
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,760
"He always carried a red diary..."

875
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:26,920
"...which was not
amongst his belongings."

876
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:29,480
"He used to record
day-to-day events in it."

877
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,040
"My mother also stated that we
never received the flask either..."

878
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:34,800
"...which he used to drink milk
or water from, for the last time."

879
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:36,600
Even Mrs.
Lalita gave the same statement...

880
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:37,880
...during her interview
with Dharmayug.

881
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:39,720
Dharmayug was a
weekly Hindi magazine.

882
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:42,280
And its editor was Dharamver Varti.

883
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:45,360
Why was Mr. Shashtri
pointing towards the flask?

884
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:48,880
Was he asking for water?

885
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:50,240
Water or milk?

886
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:52,240
The real question is what
were the contents of that flask?

887
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:54,920
Shashtri sir used to regularly
take a laxative at night.

888
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:59,000
And as always, his attendant
served him milk in the flask.

889
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:00,800
It's all recorded in my book.

890
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:02,000
Agreed.

891
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,520
His attendant served
him milk in the flask.

892
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:06,680
But the flask was lying flat...

893
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:08,000
Meaning it was empty.

894
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:10,000
Whatever its content,
milk or water...

895
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:11,360
...was already consumed.

896
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:15,160
Could Mr. Shashtri have
been trying to say...

897
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:18,640
...that his condition was due to
drinking the contents of the flask?

898
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,120
Did it contain poison?

899
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:27,080
Why the flask?

900
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:29,240
Poison can also be in the air.

901
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:31,720
That's your job to find out.
You are the historian.

902
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,080
No, no, this is
not a laughing matter.

903
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:35,200
Look here, Jha.

904
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:38,600
Every Historian's job
is to record the events...

905
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:40,440
...and not reshape it
according to our convenience.

906
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:43,640
And every historical
fact is being restructured.

907
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:45,960
The flask was straight
or lying flat.

908
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:48,960
What was the angle of the flask?
How does it all matter?

909
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:52,160
How does it matter if
the PM was pointing towards it?

910
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,320
A man who's experiencing
a heart attack could be wading

911
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:59,120
his hand in any direction.

912
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:00,760
Common Sense?

913
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:04,680
Historians have been doing
their research for over 50 years...

914
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:06,560
...but no one raised
such questions before.

915
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:10,080
How far was the Dancha?
Did they have oxygen or not?

916
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:12,840
How does the content of
the flask make any difference?

917
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:14,880
Everyone agrees that
he suffered a heart attack.

918
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:17,520
Yes...
- Here we go again. Here we go again.

919
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:19,800
If everyone agreed, then why was this
committee formed in the first place.

920
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:22,600
What are we all doing here?
- I don't know, you tell me.

921
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:25,000
The question should
have been that...

922
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,760
...why weren't the contents of the flask
sent for a forensic investigation?

923
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:30,880
How could they, Ananth?
Because the flask went missing.

924
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,560
Same as the doctor's diary.

925
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:34,120
So the question that arises is...

926
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:35,960
...what happened
to his personal diary?

927
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:40,400
Why do you look at me every time
you have a doubt in your mind?

928
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:43,080
Sir, what does lack
of evidence point to?

929
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:46,760
Look Kashyap, lack of evidence
cannot be evidence itself.

930
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:47,960
Absolutely.
- Exactly my point.

931
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:49,000
You come back to that same...

932
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:52,320
Cool down.

933
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:55,360
Calm down. - The question is
whether there was reasonable doubt.

934
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:56,760
Calm down.
- He's the most experienced.

935
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:58,240
Why aren't we asking him?
- Calm down.

936
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:00,120
Yelling and screaming
will not lead to anything.

937
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:02,320
It's not the solution.

938
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:10,600
Well, at least we all agree that
the medical report is correct...

939
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:15,560
...and we have no other
evidence to prove it wrong.

940
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,360
Which medical report, sir?

941
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:19,240
What?

942
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:20,760
Which medical report, sir?

943
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:21,840
Indian or Soviet?

944
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,240
What difference does it make?
- What do you mean?

945
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:25,360
There is...

946
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:30,880
We were told the Indian and Soviet
were each given a medical report.

947
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:32,120
Identical.

948
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:33,760
Same to same.
- Yes...

949
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,160
But that information is wrong.

950
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:36,960
Because they were not identical.

951
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:39,840
Because one report states
that it can be considered...

952
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:43,680
...that the death was due to an
acute attack of infark-myocardio.

953
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:46,600
Whereas the other report
states that it may be considered...

954
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:50,040
...that the death was caused
by the myocardial infarction.

955
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:52,200
How can that be identical?
- My God, what is all this?

956
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:55,440
Could be a spelling mistake or
a translation error or something.

957
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:59,160
if these reports were identical,
then how can there be a mistake?

958
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:01,680
Exactly my point, thank you.
Thank you, sir.

959
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:03,000
Look here, sir.

960
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:05,480
One report states that
he was given glucose,

961
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:07,840
adrenalin, and potassium chloride.

962
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:09,920
The other report states
that he was given glucose,

963
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,560
adrenalin, and calcium chloride.

964
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:12,720
So, isn't there a difference
between potassium chloride

965
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:14,320
and calcium chloride?

966
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:15,520
Yes, they are two different things.

967
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:17,680
Rumors. Just baseless rumors.

968
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:18,600
Let me tell you.

969
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:23,000
The words for potassium and calcium
are very similar in Russian.

970
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:27,480
'Cali' means Potassium
and 'Calci' means Calcium.

971
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,320
So the guy who translated
the Russian report...

972
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:34,800
...translated 'Calci' wrong,
and he wrote potassium,

973
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,560
whereas it should've been Calcium.

974
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:37,520
Okay, ma'am.

975
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:39,200
Then tell me this...

976
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:42,480
Only 6 Soviet doctors
signed the report prepared

977
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:45,000
by the Indian doctor Dr. Chug.

978
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:48,720
But exactly 3 days later when
the Soviet report was prepared...

979
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,680
...it was signed
by 8 Soviet doctors.

980
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:54,160
Two more doctors signed this report.
- That is a point.

981
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:57,440
And one of them was...
- Dr. Shamirzen.

982
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:58,480
Dr. Shamirzen.

983
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:01,560
And the other was...
Yes...Dr. EG Yeremenko.

984
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:04,080
The senior doctor who
arrived on the spot first.

985
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:06,720
And when she couldn't revive
Mr. Shashtri...

986
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,600
When Premiere Kosygin asked
Yeremenko why she couldn't revive him...

987
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:12,360
...she stated this...

988
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:16,520
"That would be possible
if death due to heart failure."

989
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,520
Revival would've been possible

990
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:23,160
only if Mr. Shashtri had
died of a heart attack.

991
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:24,920
That means she was
out-and-out in doubt...

992
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,840
...which is why she signed
the report which as doubtful.

993
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:30,680
What is the source
of your information?

994
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:34,360
Same place you should have.

995
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:42,080
Fake news writers
don't have any sources.

996
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:45,440
Oh, Ayesha ma'am...

997
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:48,360
You know ma'am when you were
honored with the Padmashri in 2012...

998
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:50,880
...I was the first to
congratulate you on Twitter.

999
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:52,000
Thank you very much.

1000
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:55,160
But that doesn't mean that you're the
only one who writes books on history.

1001
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:57,160
Are you two on Twitter?

1002
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:58,440
Come on, Jha.

1003
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:03,320
Everything I said...is
available on this book.

1004
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:04,720
It's all mentioned here.

1005
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:05,920
Malkani.

1006
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:07,440
K.R. Malkani.

1007
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:08,920
The Governor of Pondicherry.

1008
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:17,720
Sir is it possible, during the Parliament
proceedings on 16th February, 1966...

1009
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,800
...the foreign minister
Swaran Singh gave a statement

1010
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:22,360
included the medical report.

1011
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:25,440
But when a copy of the
same procedure was published...

1012
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:27,760
...the medical reports
were missing. Why?

1013
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:29,680
Maybe they forgot to add it.

1014
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:32,200
Anyone can make a mistake.

1015
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:33,880
Sir, mistake in the parliament
- No, no, no...

1016
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:35,480
proceeding...

1017
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:38,560
That is an important point,
we cannot ignore it.

1018
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:42,320
When the government has
systematically ignored Mr. Shashtri...

1019
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:43,680
...then this doesn't
make a point at all?

1020
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,200
Excuse me, Ms. Roy.

1021
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:46,840
What do you mean by
"systematically ignore"?

1022
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:51,560
I think there's nothing
left to debate over this issue.

1023
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:53,280
And yet...

1024
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:57,600
Yet...if you believe that we
should continue...

1025
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:02,280
I mean continue debating over it,
then raise your hand.

1026
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:09,840
Sir, your honor.

1027
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:12,880
Why did you raise your hand?

1028
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:22,240
After everything,
I heard and read here...

1029
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:28,480
...I am convinced that there is something
fishy about Mr. Shashtri's death.

1030
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:31,680
Yes...sure of that.

1031
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:19,080
Imran, what do you know
about Mr. Shastri?

1032
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:23,520
He was an honest
and a great Prime Minister.

1033
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:25,600
Won the war against Pakistan.

1034
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:30,240
But if the war had not happened...

1035
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:31,320
Sit...

1036
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:33,360
Sit.

1037
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:35,600
But if the war had not
happened in the first place...

1038
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:37,480
...he would still be
an honest Prime Minister.

1039
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:41,480
But would he still
be a 'Great' PM...

1040
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:44,680
...if he hadn't died
that night in Tashkent?

1041
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:51,160
People forget one's
mistakes and weaknesses...

1042
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:53,200
...after a single victory.

1043
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:54,960
No one remembers that

1044
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:58,520
there was a no-confidence motion against
Mr. Shashtri in the Parliament.

1045
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:00,560
And it was Vijaylalaxmi
Pandit who brought it in motion.

1046
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:03,640
She had said that the Minister
and his Colleagues had become

1047
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:07,680
prisoners of Indecision.

1048
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:12,440
But all these people
remember is his victory.

1049
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:16,640
If this girl succeeds...

1050
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:20,720
...no one will remember
that she writes fake news.

1051
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:25,800
Everything all right, Imran?

1052
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:33,840
She meets with a traitor

1053
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:37,400
in Tashkent...
and no one bothers to inform me.

1054
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:43,400
You said that you
can handle your wife.

1055
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:45,320
I mean your ex-wife.

1056
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:48,760
"All father said
was what is the news."

1057
01:05:48,840 --> 01:05:52,360
"To which he replied
that the people seem angry..."

1058
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:55,600
"...how you can sign
the Tashkent Declaration?"

1059
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:58,880
"But father replied
with a smile..."

1060
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,720
"...there is nothing
to be worried about."

1061
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:03,800
"Let me return to my country..."

1062
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:08,200
"When I tell them
the real reason..."

1063
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:12,600
"...I am sure the entire
country will side with me."

1064
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:15,400
As a son, I have a big question...

1065
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:18,040
What was that important
piece of news father had?

1066
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:20,040
Was it a big secret?

1067
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,400
Could that secret be this?

1068
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:26,680
Fake news.

1069
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:28,680
Ms. Ayesha, back in those days...

1070
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:31,200
...there were no
fake news or Photoshop.

1071
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:34,160
This is a common conspiracy theory.

1072
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:39,200
That Mr. Shashtri and Netaji Bose
had a secret meeting in Tashkent.

1073
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:40,640
Oh, come on, Shyam.

1074
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,760
Bose died in an air crash in 1945.

1075
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:46,960
Shashtri went to Tashkent in 1966.

1076
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,480
Look at the gap?

1077
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:49,400
21 years.

1078
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:51,320
No, no, Netaji didn't
die in a plane crash.

1079
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:52,400
He was alive.

1080
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:54,280
This is just a story
that was sold to this country...

1081
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:56,240
...and we all know
who sold it to us.

1082
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:59,800
Yes, even I believe that Netaji
did come to India, but secretly.

1083
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:00,880
Wonderful.

1084
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:03,200
Next, you will talk
about Gumnami Baba as well.

1085
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:04,960
Who is Gumnami Baba?

1086
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:07,440
After Netaji went missing...

1087
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:12,240
...Netaji Bose came to Ayodhya
disguised as Gumnami Baba.

1088
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,760
It's mentioned in
Justice Shah's report.

1089
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:18,720
This definitely proves that we
didn't gather here to know the truth...

1090
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:21,680
...but to create a mythology.

1091
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:23,320
Thank God, ma'am.

1092
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:25,800
At least we're not writing
mythology in the name of history.

1093
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:29,560
Excuse me.

1094
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:32,880
Ms. Ayesha, Dr. Homi.J. Bhabha...

1095
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:36,920
...who was given charge of India's
Nuclear Program by Mr. Shashtri...

1096
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:44,640
...his plane crashes in the Alps, exactly
13 days after Mr. Shashtri's death.

1097
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:47,520
Is this just a coincidence?

1098
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:50,360
No. It was an accident.

1099
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:51,680
Really?

1100
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:53,160
Sir, I've something
to show all of you.

1101
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:55,960
This book...
called Conversations with the Crew.

1102
01:07:56,520 --> 01:08:02,760
A high ranking CIA officer Robert Crowley
gave an interview to Gregory Douglas.

1103
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:05,960
I am going to read out a small, but
important snippet of this interview.

1104
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:09,160
During the interview, Douglas
asked him who are these jokers.

1105
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:10,560
Who are they?

1106
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:13,480
And Crowley replied that
he doesn't exist anymore.

1107
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,200
And his name was Bhabha.

1108
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:20,760
And when Bhabha was traveling to
Vienna, on a 747 Boeing airplane Plane...

1109
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:24,720
...when an explosion occurred
in the plane's cargo section.

1110
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:28,400
The plane, it's passengers
and crew, disappeared.

1111
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:30,800
Crowley even says here
that there as no real evidence

1112
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:32,440
and the world was
a much safer place.

1113
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:34,000
Oh, come on, Kashyap.

1114
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:36,120
What rubbish.

1115
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:41,640
The death of one Bha Bha
made the world a much safer place.

1116
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:43,000
Dr. Homi...

1117
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:44,600
Dr. Homi Bhabha.

1118
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:45,600
One Bhabha...

1119
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:46,880
Whatever!

1120
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:50,600
But we're talking about America,
the biggest country in the world.

1121
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:53,960
And their CIA was forced
to kill one of our scientists,

1122
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:55,720
to make the world a safer place.

1123
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:57,120
Device a conspiracy
on such a large scale?

1124
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:58,360
Are you serious?

1125
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:01,720
They could've rigged
his car with explosives...

1126
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:04,480
...or killed him in the park or
even drugged his sweets for god sakes.

1127
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:06,680
Anything...
- What a coincidence...

1128
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:08,560
Unbelievable.

1129
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:09,960
Same question.

1130
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:11,160
Identical.

1131
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:13,080
As you said, sir. Identical.

1132
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:16,440
Douglas asked Crowley
the same question.

1133
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:18,640
And do you know what
Crowley replied...

1134
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:24,960
The cow-loving,
ragged-looking, stupid leader...

1135
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:29,200
...had come pretty close to building a
nuclear bomb, with the help of Bhabha.

1136
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:32,120
And it had become crucial
for us to get him out of the way.

1137
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:35,560
And we got rid of that cow-loving,

1138
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:40,440
ragged looking, leader
and Bhabha at the blink of an eye.

1139
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:45,160
So sir...

1140
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:49,000
who according to the
CIA was that cow-loving,

1141
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:53,280
ragged-looking, stupid leader?

1142
01:09:56,480 --> 01:10:03,120
It was the 2nd Prime Minister
of India Mr. Lal Bahadur Shashtri.

1143
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:10,000
And let me read out
Crowley's exact lines to you.

1144
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:11,360
This is what he wrote.

1145
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:13,920
Here...

1146
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:17,360
"We knocked up Bhabha
and nailed Shashtri!"

1147
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:20,760
We knocked up Bhabha
and nailed Shashtri?

1148
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:21,880
Yes...

1149
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:25,080
What is this?
Some kind of video game?

1150
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:27,800
Bloody capitalists.

1151
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:33,840
Imperialistic cold-blooded
murderers, savages.

1152
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:36,720
Make the rich, richer
and the poor, poorer.

1153
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:37,960
That's it.

1154
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:41,120
And what do we do?

1155
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:44,280
We give them the
red carpet treatment.

1156
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:47,840
In the name of Globalisation,
and liberalization. My foot.

1157
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:52,280
This is just a scam with
the population of our country...

1158
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:55,080
...to make them slaves
to American Corporate Culture.

1159
01:10:55,440 --> 01:11:00,360
You know, Globalisation is just
another word for Corporate Slavery.

1160
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:03,280
They won't use their guns on us...

1161
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:06,440
...but rather kill us with their
burgers, and fries, and Colas.

1162
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:10,920
You know we need to end this
capitalism before it ends us all.

1163
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,560
Socialism must have claimed

1164
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:17,840
at least 60 million innocent lives.

1165
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:19,960
Crowley was lying.

1166
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:22,360
Oh really...
- The book is right in front of you...

1167
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:24,760
Forget the book.
He was a retired man...

1168
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:27,320
Anyone can make any number
of claims after leaving the CIA.

1169
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:30,080
You just use the facts
that suit your story.

1170
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:32,880
Why would anyone lie about such
a prominent figure in the world?

1171
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,320
Do you have any logic for this?
- Identity.

1172
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:38,200
Recognition.

1173
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:45,000
After retiring, a person loses
his powers as well as his identity.

1174
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:54,200
And in order to gain it back,

1175
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:00,360
...they can go to any lengths.

1176
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:02,680
Anything at all.

1177
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:07,560
Even resort to lying.

1178
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:09,000
Yes...

1179
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:45,080
What is your password?

1180
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:47,840
You can't be here.

1181
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:49,520
You've changed it.

1182
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:52,000
You're forgetting
the court orders, Imran?

1183
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:54,960
You can't be within a
500-meter radius of my house.

1184
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:58,560
You can't be within
a 5-meter radius of my Minister.

1185
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:00,000
I'm going to call the Police.

1186
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:03,760
Call the police, huh.

1187
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:06,000
Let things continue
the way they are.

1188
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:09,000
You're never going to
win this game. Understand.

1189
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:10,200
So stop it.

1190
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:13,120
And what if I don't.

1191
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:17,720
There will be consequences
for obstructing our path.

1192
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:22,880
Coming from the man who
once said that he will protect me.

1193
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:25,520
You're not that woman anymore.

1194
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:28,120
You've never been a man.

1195
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,400
Natrajan's dog.

1196
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:43,320
The Police are going
to stay with you 24/7.

1197
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:46,280
As long as you're under threat.

1198
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:55,520
"They don't believe"

1199
01:13:55,600 --> 01:14:00,120
"what you say, Radha."

1200
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:05,280
"...what you say, Radha."

1201
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:08,000
"...what you say, Radha."

1202
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:11,160
Welcome. Welcome.
- Welcome, sir. Welcome.

1203
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:14,480
Happy Anniversary.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

1204
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:19,600
How's the inquiry coming?

1205
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:22,840
Well, ...they've made a union.

1206
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:26,520
Is there a nut that wouldn't crack?

1207
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:34,280
We can swing Indira to our side...

1208
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:37,800
...if the Tax-inquiry against
her NGO is withdrawn.

1209
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:40,440
Please help yourself. Hello.

1210
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:41,600
Hi, ma'am.

1211
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:46,520
"...what you say, Radha."

1212
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:49,480
A talk needs to be had
with the committee.

1213
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:52,000
Yeah, I've been waiting all...

1214
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:53,800
Ma'am?

1215
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,080
Stop.

1216
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:56,680
Mr. Natrajan

1217
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:01,920
What the hell.

1218
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:07,240
What are you doing here?

1219
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:08,800
To meet Mr. Natrajan.
- No, you're not meeting anyone.

1220
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:11,480
No, I've to meet him...
- You're not meeting anyone.

1221
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:13,240
Imran... Imran...

1222
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:15,640
I have invited her.

1223
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:20,960
Can I get you something to drink?

1224
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:22,240
Why aren't you killing me?

1225
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:24,920
My dear,

1226
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:27,400
we go by Law.

1227
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:31,760
Why are you scared if you
haven't done anything wrong?

1228
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:35,160
Even evil-doers are
never afraid of anyone.

1229
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:38,320
Who are you talking about?

1230
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:40,240
The people who killed Mr. Shashtri.

1231
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:43,920
aYour Committee is conducting
an investigation about it.

1232
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:45,120
Committee.

1233
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:47,360
It's just a farce,
like a reality show.

1234
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:49,560
Everything is scripted and staged.

1235
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:52,200
Their agenda isn't finding
the truth, but to create a lie...

1236
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:53,920
...because none of you have
the courage to face the truth...

1237
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,200
Oh come on,
let's not talk about courage.

1238
01:15:56,840 --> 01:16:02,200
Courage is not about speaking in front
of the camera, but staying silent.

1239
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:05,880
...to decide what's

1240
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:09,920
right and what's not for the
population of 1.25 billion people.

1241
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:17,000
...to sacrifice your provisions
for the greater good.

1242
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:20,920
...and to abstain
from speaking the truth,

1243
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:25,480
even though you know it.

1244
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:32,960
A country that's caught
up in its past can never progress.

1245
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:36,480
One needs the courage
to detach from the past.

1246
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:37,680
Past...

1247
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:42,760
One can forget the past,
but not run from it.

1248
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:47,480
Because someday it comes face-to-face,
as it will happen in this case.

1249
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:52,360
And that day we'll
talk about courage again.

1250
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:56,240
Are you trying to threaten me?

1251
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:00,520
No, sir.

1252
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:04,840
I am informing you that
I reject your Police protection.

1253
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:07,480
Because this isn't about Mr.
Shashtri anymore...

1254
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:10,360
...but the right of a citizen.

1255
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:14,000
My right to truth.

1256
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:27,280
Ragini Phule has denied
Police protection.

1257
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:30,320
She mentioned in her Facebook post
that she is being pressurized...

1258
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:33,240
...to mislead the
committee's findings.

1259
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:38,360
There were too many
coincidences in this case...

1260
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:44,240
...like Dr. Chug meeting with an accident,
where he and his wife died.

1261
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:46,640
And there was no inquiry ordered.

1262
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,480
Even Ramnath,
his personal assistant...

1263
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:52,440
...met with an accident once,
where he survived.

1264
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:56,120
But then he met with another accident,
which happened right here in Janpath...

1265
01:17:56,760 --> 01:17:57,960
...that left him crippled.

1266
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:00,080
Later he passed away.

1267
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:05,080
There were only two witnesses
in Lal Bahadur Shashtri's case.

1268
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:09,840
His personal assistant, Ramnath.

1269
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:13,360
And the other was Dr. Chug.

1270
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:16,320
Both of them, coincidentally,
died in an accident...

1271
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:20,040
...on two separate days, of course.

1272
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:22,160
Two witnesses.

1273
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:24,400
And they both died.

1274
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:27,280
Again...

1275
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:32,320
No witnesses, no case... Nothing!

1276
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:36,840
Striking coincidence.

1277
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:39,840
Even science and common sense
can't find an answer to this.

1278
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:41,600
What would you call it?

1279
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,560
It's...exactly like fiction.

1280
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:46,440
Life is fiction, Indira.

1281
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:49,400
I know, but we're here
to find the truth, aren't we?

1282
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:51,600
But truth is a luxury, my dear.

1283
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:57,280
This is why some
cases never get solved.

1284
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:03,360
Jeep case, money-laundering,
chopper-scam, cash-for-vote scam.

1285
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:07,400
Bellari Mining case, Telgi case,

1286
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:10,880
Truth is indeed a
luxury in our country.

1287
01:19:11,240 --> 01:19:13,960
There are a couple of other
luxuries you forgot to mention.

1288
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:16,320
Lalit Narayan Mishra's murder.

1289
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:18,600
Shama Prasad Mukherjee.
Deen Dayal Upadhyay case.

1290
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:21,880
CWG, 2G, Union Carbide, Bofors.

1291
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:23,160
Even Gumnami Baba.

1292
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:25,600
Kashyap, don't look at me.

1293
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:29,440
It's the handiwork of people like you.
- Please, sir. It's very irritating.

1294
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:34,880
Intelligence Agencies always
submit detailed evidence.

1295
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:40,800
We all know who
makes them disappear.

1296
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:49,280
When the jury tries hostile witnesses
or cases with missing evidence ...

1297
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:51,680
...then there's nothing
much they can do.

1298
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:53,000
Sir.

1299
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:55,760
Are you trying to say that

1300
01:19:56,160 --> 01:20:00,120
all the witness related to Mr.
Shashtri's case were murdered...

1301
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:02,120
...and all evidence,
documents went missing.

1302
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:05,000
Behave yourself, young girl.
Behave yourself!

1303
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:06,720
I never said that.

1304
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:08,160
No, I never said it.

1305
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:10,120
Sir, I don't think
she meant to insult you.

1306
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:13,840
We...we're not going
to record any of this.

1307
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:16,640
And you...
Come here.

1308
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:27,360
You will not say anything
like this ever again.

1309
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:30,680
India is not an autocracy...

1310
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:34,960
...its a successful
democracy in the world.

1311
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:37,720
- Democracy.
- Yes.

1312
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:40,120
- Really?
- Yes...

1313
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:44,800
Maybe that's why no one from
my generation knows that the

1314
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:47,720
Nuclear program,
Green revolution...

1315
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:53,160
...White revolution, the fact that India
is a world leader in milk production...

1316
01:20:53,240 --> 01:20:55,200
...was started by Mr. Shashtri.

1317
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:59,440
Mr. Shashtri was the first
Economic reformer of India.

1318
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:01,640
And no one knows this.

1319
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:05,840
And there's another thing
I want to tell all of you.

1320
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:07,800
Not as Indira Joseph Roy...

1321
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:11,160
...but as a mother.

1322
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:17,720
It's so shameful,
that even my son is unaware...

1323
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:21,560
...that 2nd of October is also
Mr. Shashtri's birthday.

1324
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:31,040
That's your democracy, sir.

1325
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:34,400
This is your education system.

1326
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:45,080
I have the least doubt in my mind
that we killed Mr. Shashtri twice.

1327
01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:48,720
First in Tashkent,

1328
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:54,840
and then we systematically erased
him from the memory of this country.

1329
01:21:58,760 --> 01:21:59,680
Sir, I've been observing that...

1330
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:01,920
...the motive of some people
here is not to find the truth.

1331
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:03,240
They want to play politics.

1332
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:05,720
Dirty politics.

1333
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:09,680
How...

1334
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:14,120
How can we forget what
Mr. Shashtri did for our country?

1335
01:22:15,080 --> 01:22:18,080
How can we erase him
from our heart and mind?

1336
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:22,000
Because this is a country
of truth and non-violence.

1337
01:22:23,240 --> 01:22:25,240
This is a country
of Gandhi and Nehru.

1338
01:22:25,480 --> 01:22:26,680
Why not Shashtri's?

1339
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:31,480
What?

1340
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:36,720
What did you say?

1341
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:40,480
Why not Shashtri's?

1342
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:41,640
Enough!

1343
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:43,120
How dare you?

1344
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:44,640
This is entirely...

1345
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:45,760
How dare you?

1346
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:46,880
Do you know who I am...

1347
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:49,000
Who do you think you are?
- Please stop him.

1348
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:53,680
Sit down.

1349
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:54,680
Who are you?

1350
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:56,120
Who do you think you are?

1351
01:22:56,240 --> 01:22:57,400
You think...
Do you know who I am?

1352
01:22:57,480 --> 01:22:59,120
Do you know where I come from?
- Mr. Rana...

1353
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:00,840
Please...

1354
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:15,640
Hello.
- Ragini, I found out.

1355
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:18,240
KP Bakshi, veteran journalist.

1356
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:19,920
Bakshi wrote a report

1357
01:23:20,240 --> 01:23:23,680
stating the Secret Service had some
connection with Shashtri's death.

1358
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:25,640
CIA?
- I don't know.

1359
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:28,720
If KP Bakshi signs up as a witness,
that will seal everyone's mouth.

1360
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:31,600
Don't be impatient, Ragini.
Bakshi will contact you, himself.

1361
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:34,160
But until then you should
study Lal Bahadur Shashtri's body.

1362
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:35,840
That will be your level 3.

1363
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:45,760
"When we saw his dead
body at the airport..."

1364
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:50,160
"...we noticed that his
face had turned blue."

1365
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:52,280
"And later, when we
spoke to some cardiologists,

1366
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:53,840
some very renowned
cardiologists..."

1367
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:57,240
...they confirmed that
the white spots on his temple,

1368
01:23:57,800 --> 01:23:59,520
are conclusive with
either snake bite..."

1369
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:03,600
"...or a poison that causes brain
hemorrhage or damage to the brain."

1370
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:05,000
Just hear what I have to say.

1371
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:07,360
Please hear me out first...

1372
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:08,800
This is not sufficient evidence.

1373
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:10,400
This is not enough evidence...

1374
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:12,480
Not enough evidence...

1375
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:17,160
When Mr. Shashtri's body
arrived at Palam Airport...

1376
01:24:17,240 --> 01:24:20,520
...it had completely swollen
up and turned black.

1377
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:22,480
It turned blue and not black.

1378
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:25,040
When the body decomposes
it turns blue.

1379
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:27,760
Its the discoloring of the skin,
what does it matter?

1380
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:28,920
One second. Sir, one second.
- Most of them were black and..

1381
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,200
One second.
- white pictures.

1382
01:24:30,360 --> 01:24:32,280
Look at this,
you decide blue or black.

1383
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:34,120
And that's not all...

1384
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:37,320
There were numerous cuts on Shashtri's
body and blood was oozing from it.

1385
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:39,800
No, no, there's no record from it.

1386
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:43,400
You see, in such situations,

1387
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:47,200
the family members
become very emotional.

1388
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:52,360
And in order to conduct a post mortem,
there has to be reasonable doubt.

1389
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:57,440
His closest friend, CP Srivastav,
had consulted two British Doctors.

1390
01:24:57,520 --> 01:24:59,640
Dr. Liam West, and Dr. Spyro.

1391
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:02,240
And they both
confirmed that the color blue

1392
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:04,760
is quite consistent with
death from natural causes.

1393
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:06,800
And what about the
cuts and the blood?

1394
01:25:07,320 --> 01:25:09,440
Is that consistent
with natural death as well?

1395
01:25:10,160 --> 01:25:13,440
if there were cuts on
his body and was bleeding...

1396
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:15,000
...then it must have stained
his clothes as well.

1397
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:17,320
And his family must
still have his clothes.

1398
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:19,280
So ask them to send it.

1399
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:23,320
Sir, could it be that someone already
conducted a post mortem in USSR.

1400
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:27,520
I studied everything and came to the
conclusion that there was no foul play...

1401
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:29,520
...and he died of a heart attack.

1402
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:30,600
Who said that?

1403
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:33,400
Since no one's
believing a historian...

1404
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:37,360
...I thought you might
believe a journalist.

1405
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:40,560
Here.

1406
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:48,680
Kuldeep Nayar,
India's most senior journalist.

1407
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,560
And Shashtri's Press Secretary.

1408
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:52,320
He was present there at that time.

1409
01:25:53,720 --> 01:25:56,000
And answer me this, if they
had any suspicion of foul play...

1410
01:25:56,080 --> 01:25:58,520
...wouldn't they have conducted
a post mortem of him in USSR?

1411
01:25:58,840 --> 01:26:00,360
Wouldn't our
government had done it?

1412
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:03,480
We're truth seekers,
not a conspiracy theorist.

1413
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:05,120
According to
Parliament proceedings,

1414
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:06,720
the Soviet Government
requested a post mortem report...

1415
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:09,400
...from the Foreign minister,
and the Home Minister.

1416
01:26:09,480 --> 01:26:11,080
But they denied.

1417
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:12,880
I've been hearing this
rubbish for a long time.

1418
01:26:13,720 --> 01:26:15,200
This was already discussed
in the parliament...

1419
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:17,280
...and the government had already given
the white paper to the Parliament.

1420
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:19,320
And White Paper is the last word?
- Yes!

1421
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:26,400
White Paper is the
Parliament's last word.

1422
01:26:28,040 --> 01:26:31,840
Parliament is the
Temple of Democracy.

1423
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,360
Temple of Democracy.

1424
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:42,040
So in that temple of democracy, when
veteran leaders like KN Singh, HV Kamath,

1425
01:26:42,120 --> 01:26:44,160
Krishnakanth,
and Atal Bihari Vajpayee...

1426
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:46,160
...demanded this
Temple of Democracy for

1427
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:48,760
a judicial inquiry,
then why wasn't it granted to them.

1428
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:51,880
What the government
did or did not do

1429
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:53,520
back then can't
be our concern today.

1430
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:57,600
That should be our concern.

1431
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:04,920
Sir...

1432
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:06,720
A question was raised in
the parliament in those days...

1433
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:08,760
...which still
remains unanswered...

1434
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,720
Who served milk to Mr. Shashtri
in the flask on that day.

1435
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:14,320
His own cook,
or the Ambassador's cook.

1436
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:17,200
If it was the Ambassador's cook,
then why on that particular day?

1437
01:27:17,560 --> 01:27:18,960
What was the name of that cook?

1438
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:22,600
Jaan Mohammad.

1439
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:28,760
Let me narrate a story
about common sense.

1440
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:36,440
A man was hanging from the roof.

1441
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:38,480
The rope was 10 feet long.

1442
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:40,520
The room was empty,

1443
01:27:41,640 --> 01:27:44,480
and there was a 10-inch distance
between his feet and the floor.

1444
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:47,920
There were no stool, table,

1445
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:49,960
or any other thing
that was 10 feet tall.

1446
01:27:50,040 --> 01:27:51,640
Just a little water
scattered around.

1447
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:55,880
So how did that man commit suicide?

1448
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:08,520
There's no science involved
in this. Common sense.

1449
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:10,720
He got an ice slab
that was 10-inch tall.

1450
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:11,800
A slab of ice...

1451
01:28:12,040 --> 01:28:13,040
...which gradually melted.

1452
01:28:14,240 --> 01:28:17,560
So Mr. Chairman, we need to
find that slab of ice in this case.

1453
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:19,720
The root of this
case is post mortem.

1454
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,240
Why wasn't a post mortem
conducted on Mr. Shashtri...

1455
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:24,520
Allow me to tell you.

1456
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:28,480
Because the post mortem would've
proved that he was poisoned.

1457
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:29,640
How?

1458
01:28:30,120 --> 01:28:32,520
In the milk,
which was in the flask...

1459
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:34,840
...to which Mr. Shashtri
was pointing at.

1460
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:38,400
So the question is who
cooked for him on that day,

1461
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:40,480
who served him the milk,
in that flask?

1462
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:41,640
Who was it?

1463
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:43,400
Jaan Mohammad.

1464
01:28:45,160 --> 01:28:46,040
Jaan Mohammad.

1465
01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:47,240
Jaan Mohammad, who?

1466
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:50,120
Who never served food
to Mr. Shashtri prior to this.

1467
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:51,640
Never cooked for him.

1468
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:53,440
Oh come on,
this is all Google knowledge.

1469
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:56,040
He had cooked for
him once before...

1470
01:28:56,120 --> 01:28:58,880
...when in 1965 Shashtri
had gone to USSR.

1471
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:01,440
That could've been a rehearsal.
- Oh, God...

1472
01:29:02,440 --> 01:29:03,480
No...

1473
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:07,000
Ramnath was Mr. Shashtri's cook.
He always accompanied him.

1474
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:09,920
He cooked for him every day.
So why not on that day?

1475
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:11,360
Why did Jaan Mohammad
cook for him on that day?

1476
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:12,440
Why?

1477
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:14,080
Was there a conspiracy behind it?

1478
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:15,920
Or was there someone
else behind this

1479
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:21,120
Jaan Mohammad, and another...

1480
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:25,440
You sound so confident
about Jaan Mohammad

1481
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:27,240
as if you had ordered the hit.

1482
01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:28,560
No, it wasn't me.

1483
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:30,640
But we all know who it was.
We just don't like to take names...

1484
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:32,400
What do you want to imply?
Be more specific.

1485
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:33,760
See...that's the problem.

1486
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:38,000
If you say anything relating to
them it's like you committed a sin.

1487
01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:39,240
Be specific.

1488
01:29:42,160 --> 01:29:46,840
How shameful that you've
stooped to such level.

1489
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:49,720
The murder of a Prime Minister
isn't shameful for you...

1490
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:52,520
...but you feel shameful
because I stooped to this level.

1491
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:54,560
The case of a man
who dropped his surname

1492
01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:57,360
at the age of 12 because
he was completely

1493
01:29:57,440 --> 01:30:00,240
against caste discrimination...

1494
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:03,480
You're doing a great
service to India's secularism.

1495
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:06,600
This...This...
This... Secularism.

1496
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:11,160
This one word has done more damage to
this country more than anything else.

1497
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:12,120
Sir, what is he saying?

1498
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:15,880
No, Mr. Kashyap, listen.
You must listen.

1499
01:30:16,360 --> 01:30:18,200
A Prime Minister is poisoned,

1500
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:20,000
the parliament is attacked,

1501
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:21,440
blasts in Mumbai...

1502
01:30:22,440 --> 01:30:24,920
Don't say anything
Secularism.

1503
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:31,760
Pathetic human being...
shameless...

1504
01:30:35,240 --> 01:30:38,360
See...she got angry and left.

1505
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:43,000
That's how they are.
Hot Blooded.

1506
01:30:43,720 --> 01:30:45,840
The only problem is that
people speak behind your backs,

1507
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:47,240
and Gangaram Jha
says it to your face.

1508
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:50,400
Someday they will be sitting next
to you on a bus, train, or flight...

1509
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:53,240
...with some kind of poison.

1510
01:30:53,640 --> 01:30:55,600
Stop them.
They are a danger.

1511
01:31:00,280 --> 01:31:01,960
You know it, Ananth sir.

1512
01:31:02,200 --> 01:31:03,320
Do something.

1513
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:08,120
Stop them...or someday they will
bring their army to kill all of us.

1514
01:31:08,680 --> 01:31:10,720
Will you just shut up?

1515
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:16,720
You can shut up Gangaram,

1516
01:31:17,720 --> 01:31:19,400
but how will you make them shut up?

1517
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:26,560
I am sorry, sir.

1518
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:33,920
I've never seen such
filth in one place before.

1519
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:06,480
Can we please come back
to why we're all here today?

1520
01:32:10,520 --> 01:32:14,280
Atal Bihari Vajpayee and
many other leaders raised

1521
01:32:14,360 --> 01:32:16,120
the point of Jaan Mohammad
in the Parliament...

1522
01:32:16,200 --> 01:32:17,920
It's all here.
- Atal Bihari Vajpayee

1523
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:19,320
was in the opposition.

1524
01:32:19,400 --> 01:32:22,160
It was his job to
oppose the government.

1525
01:32:22,240 --> 01:32:23,560
All right,
what about Malkani's book?

1526
01:32:23,640 --> 01:32:24,800
It's written here
in Malkani's book, that...

1527
01:32:24,920 --> 01:32:27,560
Come on, it's an autobiography,
he can write anything.

1528
01:32:28,280 --> 01:32:30,720
Just like you wrote in your book.
Anything.

1529
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:33,920
I wrote my books on my own merits.

1530
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:37,640
And I didn't have to sleep
with anyone to survive.

1531
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:38,960
Ohh...

1532
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:43,080
What did you just say?

1533
01:32:48,840 --> 01:32:50,000
What is this?

1534
01:32:51,240 --> 01:32:52,560
What is this place?

1535
01:32:54,640 --> 01:32:56,360
Sir, I take very
strong objection...

1536
01:32:56,440 --> 01:32:59,560
And I take very strong objection
to what you guys are doing here!

1537
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:03,400
You're trying to
create confusion. Chaos.

1538
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:08,120
Are you unaware of
what's going on here?

1539
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:14,960
We're debating over trivial
issues so everyone gets confused.

1540
01:33:16,040 --> 01:33:19,320
Letting loose a number
of theories out there...

1541
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:21,440
...so that over a period of
time people believe it to be true.

1542
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:26,640
Like no one ever landed on the moon,
the government planned 9/11...

1543
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:28,840
Gandhi was shot a second time.

1544
01:33:28,920 --> 01:33:31,200
Bose was Gumnami Baba.

1545
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:33,920
Shashtri was poisoned.

1546
01:33:34,160 --> 01:33:36,240
All this is called...

1547
01:33:36,680 --> 01:33:38,120
This is called Dim lighting.

1548
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:42,600
Lower the light in the room to
an extent where everything fades away...

1549
01:33:42,680 --> 01:33:45,640
...and no one finds
out the truth or lie.

1550
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:50,520
Shastri died of a heart attack!
Everything else is a lie!

1551
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:52,440
Because you said so in your book.

1552
01:33:52,520 --> 01:33:54,560
You're the last word. That's why.

1553
01:34:06,840 --> 01:34:07,920
Ms. Ayesha...

1554
01:34:21,240 --> 01:34:23,280
It's a war of narratives.

1555
01:34:26,280 --> 01:34:30,000
We dedicated our lives
in recording history.

1556
01:34:31,640 --> 01:34:34,280
And you guys want to
create a new narrative now.

1557
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:36,720
And based on what?

1558
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:39,680
Your fake article,
fake news, and fake facts.

1559
01:34:40,440 --> 01:34:41,960
Just like your fake ideology.

1560
01:34:43,880 --> 01:34:48,080
And this is a dangerous trend,
I am telling you.

1561
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:50,960
This is a big issue.

1562
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:55,280
This is about you and me.

1563
01:34:55,880 --> 01:34:58,880
It's about our
future generations...

1564
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:04,560
Will people believe an expert's
opinion or a non-expert's fake news.

1565
01:35:06,040 --> 01:35:08,360
And we're talking about
history for God's sake.

1566
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:11,720
Let the historians
decide what's correct.

1567
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:18,320
And what if history proves
you wrong in the future?

1568
01:35:27,640 --> 01:35:31,080
Hello.
- Bakshi speaking.

1569
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:33,720
I've filled the witness form.

1570
01:35:34,840 --> 01:35:35,960
Thank you.

1571
01:35:36,160 --> 01:35:37,560
Thank you very much.

1572
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:40,880
I think it's time,
to tell the truth.

1573
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:43,360
We have to meet.

1574
01:35:43,960 --> 01:35:46,880
Sunday morning, Parliament street.

1575
01:35:59,160 --> 01:36:00,040
Thank you.

1576
01:36:02,200 --> 01:36:05,600
The 2nd Prime Minister
of world's largest democracy...

1577
01:36:07,160 --> 01:36:08,200
...goes to Tashkent

1578
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:10,960
Signs the war treaty

1579
01:36:11,800 --> 01:36:12,880
And dies.

1580
01:36:15,120 --> 01:36:17,040
Thousands of suspicions
are raised...

1581
01:36:18,160 --> 01:36:19,120
But

1582
01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:20,680
No CBI,

1583
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:22,320
No IB,

1584
01:36:23,240 --> 01:36:24,320
No SIT...

1585
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,880
Not even an Inquiry Commission.

1586
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:32,360
Mr. Shashtri's murder
investigation...

1587
01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:35,400
It hasn't been proven murder yet.

1588
01:36:36,240 --> 01:36:37,360
Of course.

1589
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:41,240
But back in those days,

1590
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:47,080
ordering a hit on an international
leader was not a big deal.

1591
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:48,960
CIA, right?

1592
01:36:49,120 --> 01:36:50,400
Do you guys really believe...

1593
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:53,800
...that the CIA
orders all the hits?

1594
01:36:54,240 --> 01:36:55,680
There are other agencies.

1595
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,400
You mean...KGB.

1596
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:00,600
But sir, why the KGB?

1597
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:03,120
Shashtri sir died in Tashkent.

1598
01:37:03,240 --> 01:37:05,920
Everyone would suspect the KGB.

1599
01:37:07,160 --> 01:37:11,480
In 1966,
when Pakistan surrendered...

1600
01:37:12,760 --> 01:37:14,960
...all the spies around the world

1601
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:17,440
knew that

1602
01:37:18,840 --> 01:37:24,920
Mr. Shashtri will be
serving a very long term as the PM.

1603
01:37:27,240 --> 01:37:33,240
And even a few entities
in India seemed concerned.

1604
01:37:34,200 --> 01:37:36,240
Lal Bahadur's case...

1605
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:41,520
...is the biggest cover-up
in the history of India.

1606
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:47,120
I think you haven't
read the Mitrokhin Archives.

1607
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:52,440
Mitrokhin Archives is the world's
best Counter-Intelligence report.

1608
01:37:52,720 --> 01:37:55,760
It led to many legal proceedings
in Britain and Italy.

1609
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:58,760
If the Indians read
the Mitrokhin archives...

1610
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,520
...it will start a civil war.

1611
01:38:01,920 --> 01:38:03,400
When our government

1612
01:38:04,640 --> 01:38:07,720
chucked the Mitrokhin
archives in the dustbin...

1613
01:38:09,080 --> 01:38:10,240
...I grew suspicious.

1614
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:15,000
And started my own research on it.

1615
01:38:16,920 --> 01:38:20,040
If my book had been
published back then,

1616
01:38:20,960 --> 01:38:22,160
it would've created a sensation.

1617
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:25,640
Because you knew that Mr.
Shashtri was murdered.

1618
01:38:30,280 --> 01:38:32,120
This is a manuscript of my book.

1619
01:38:33,120 --> 01:38:35,480
Read it carefully.

1620
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:38,280
It will answer many
of your questions.

1621
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:42,440
And if I'm not around anymore...

1622
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:45,240
...then get it published for me.

1623
01:38:46,360 --> 01:38:47,680
Good luck.

1624
01:38:57,440 --> 01:38:59,080
Did Mr. Shashtri also
meet with the same fate?

1625
01:39:05,800 --> 01:39:08,920
Ragini Phule tried
to meet with Mr. Bakshi

1626
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:11,360
outside the Shashtri
Committee's knowledge...

1627
01:39:11,880 --> 01:39:15,000
...where Bakshi met with an
accident and was run over by a bus.

1628
01:39:15,560 --> 01:39:17,600
It was completely
the bus driver's fault.

1629
01:39:17,720 --> 01:39:18,640
Help!
- But

1630
01:39:18,760 --> 01:39:20,160
shouldn't Ragini Phule
have been more responsible?

1631
01:39:20,280 --> 01:39:21,360
Help!

1632
01:39:21,560 --> 01:39:23,760
Isn't it unconstitutional
to meet a witness outside

1633
01:39:23,880 --> 01:39:25,320
the committee's knowledge?

1634
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:26,280
Isn't it treason?

1635
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:27,040
Help!

1636
01:39:27,160 --> 01:39:29,440
Can our constitution be
railroaded just to know the truth?

1637
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:33,040
Tonight at 9 we will discuss
the role of a journalist in

1638
01:39:33,480 --> 01:39:36,040
their quest to find the truth.

1639
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:38,680
You know, Kaiser.

1640
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:45,720
Mr. Tripathi's student has
broken the official Secret's act.

1641
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:49,640
Stay. Stay. Stay, son.

1642
01:39:50,760 --> 01:39:58,600
She is unlawfully influencing,
intimidating witnesses.

1643
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:03,760
It's a national security risk.

1644
01:40:07,880 --> 01:40:09,040
It was risky.

1645
01:40:11,480 --> 01:40:14,320
What if she had
ended up dead instead?

1646
01:40:18,160 --> 01:40:19,200
But...

1647
01:40:21,480 --> 01:40:25,520
Politics is all about precision.

1648
01:40:25,640 --> 01:40:27,200
People all over
the country staged protests

1649
01:40:27,320 --> 01:40:29,400
against committee
member Ragini Phule.

1650
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:33,560
She has been accused
of misleading witness Bakshi...

1651
01:40:33,680 --> 01:40:35,640
...and also for
conspiring his death.

1652
01:40:35,880 --> 01:40:36,960
Now we must wait

1653
01:40:37,080 --> 01:40:40,240
and see what will be the
next step of the Committee chairman

1654
01:40:40,360 --> 01:40:41,600
Shyam Sunder Tripathi.

1655
01:40:41,720 --> 01:40:46,360
This committee with
a majority has decided,

1656
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:50,760
on account of the serious
allegations against Ragini Phule...

1657
01:40:51,320 --> 01:40:55,400
...she is fired
from this committee.

1658
01:40:56,480 --> 01:40:57,560
Thank you...

1659
01:40:57,840 --> 01:40:59,000
Sir...

1660
01:41:02,360 --> 01:41:07,680
What will be committee chairman
Shyam Sunder Tripathi's next step?

1661
01:41:44,680 --> 01:41:46,280
Why did you do it, sir?

1662
01:41:49,560 --> 01:41:50,600
Go away.

1663
01:41:51,080 --> 01:41:52,880
You shouldn't be here.

1664
01:41:53,120 --> 01:41:55,000
You know it was a conspiracy.

1665
01:41:55,960 --> 01:41:57,440
Let the court decide that.

1666
01:41:59,040 --> 01:42:00,480
I want to come as a witness.

1667
01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:05,160
The committee gets to
decide who will be a witness.

1668
01:42:05,320 --> 01:42:06,280
Go away.

1669
01:42:06,760 --> 01:42:09,720
If a citizen has
no right to know the truth...

1670
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:11,480
...then at least they should
be allowed to tell the truth.

1671
01:42:15,160 --> 01:42:16,120
You know, sir,

1672
01:42:17,800 --> 01:42:19,160
puppetry is the only
art in this world...

1673
01:42:19,280 --> 01:42:23,400
...where the puppet doesn't know that
someone else is pulling the strings.

1674
01:42:24,840 --> 01:42:30,520
And I think you're much
qualified than being a puppet.

1675
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:38,440
So it's up to you whether
you will help me, or...

1676
01:42:51,640 --> 01:42:55,440
"Everything goes..."

1677
01:42:56,360 --> 01:42:58,640
Ragini Phule...
- Down-Down...

1678
01:42:58,760 --> 01:43:01,160
Ragini Phule...
- Down-Down...

1679
01:43:01,280 --> 01:43:03,400
Ragini is it true that
you met with traitors.

1680
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:05,480
You tried to
intimidate the witness.

1681
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:06,720
You're in cahoots
with the traitors.

1682
01:43:06,840 --> 01:43:08,280
You meet with traitors.

1683
01:43:08,400 --> 01:43:10,200
You bloody anti-national.

1684
01:43:10,440 --> 01:43:13,640
Ragini!

1685
01:43:13,720 --> 01:43:15,960
Ragini, the people want to know!

1686
01:43:16,040 --> 01:43:18,600
Ragini, the people want to know!

1687
01:44:03,800 --> 01:44:05,480
I am sure by now
you've understood that

1688
01:44:05,600 --> 01:44:08,520
fighting against a corrupt system
is not an easy task, Ragini.

1689
01:44:10,280 --> 01:44:11,520
I lost.

1690
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:12,760
You cannot step down now...

1691
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:14,440
...and they won't let
you go any further.

1692
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:16,240
But there is always hope, Ragini.

1693
01:44:16,840 --> 01:44:17,800
Hope?

1694
01:44:18,160 --> 01:44:19,800
What hope are you talking about?

1695
01:44:20,320 --> 01:44:23,320
I lost my job.
All my savings are gone.

1696
01:44:23,440 --> 01:44:25,280
I got fired from the committee.

1697
01:44:25,680 --> 01:44:27,360
KP Bakshi died because of me.

1698
01:44:27,720 --> 01:44:30,760
They are calling me a traitor.
A defector.

1699
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,120
They are calling me anti-national,
and you're talking about hope.

1700
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:34,520
What hope?

1701
01:44:34,680 --> 01:44:36,440
But you didn't kill Mr.
Shashtri, Ragini.

1702
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:37,640
Then who did?

1703
01:44:37,880 --> 01:44:39,640
Who?
Did you kill him?

1704
01:44:39,760 --> 01:44:40,920
Who are you?

1705
01:44:41,160 --> 01:44:43,320
I think you ordered the hit on Mr.
Shashtri.

1706
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:45,880
What do you want?

1707
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:50,480
Why did you make me do this?
Why?

1708
01:44:50,640 --> 01:44:53,600
Because you wanted to be
successful at any cost, Ragini.

1709
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:54,880
Whatever it took.

1710
01:44:55,240 --> 01:44:57,360
And that was your biggest
qualification as well.

1711
01:44:57,680 --> 01:45:00,280
Deep assets are not made in a day,
and they are not easy.

1712
01:45:00,640 --> 01:45:02,680
You're not the first or the last.

1713
01:45:02,760 --> 01:45:07,000
No one's ever found out who's
the puppet here, or the puppeteer.

1714
01:45:07,120 --> 01:45:08,600
That's why you're our deep asset.

1715
01:45:08,760 --> 01:45:09,880
To hell with you.

1716
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:11,800
I am nobody's deep asset.

1717
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,080
I am no one's deep asset,
and you...

1718
01:45:14,960 --> 01:45:16,120
I am going to find you.

1719
01:45:16,360 --> 01:45:17,960
I will find you.

1720
01:45:18,200 --> 01:45:19,520
You can never find me, Ragini.

1721
01:45:19,640 --> 01:45:20,680
Deep asset!

1722
01:45:22,120 --> 01:45:25,880
Because the puppet never
knows who the puppeteer is.

1723
01:45:26,240 --> 01:45:28,600
Politicians, Police, Journalists,

1724
01:45:28,720 --> 01:45:30,920
Officers, Writers, Lawyers, NGOs,

1725
01:45:31,040 --> 01:45:34,080
Film-Makers, Jihadis, Terrorists,
saints, sages, stone-pelters...

1726
01:45:34,360 --> 01:45:36,080
...they are all someone's puppet.

1727
01:45:36,280 --> 01:45:37,160
But they don't know that.

1728
01:45:37,320 --> 01:45:41,480
This chain itself doesn't
know where it begins or ends.

1729
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:44,720
Just like the eternal lingering
question of whether God exists or not...

1730
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:47,240
...and that is
His biggest strength.

1731
01:45:47,400 --> 01:45:48,440
Who are you?

1732
01:45:50,920 --> 01:45:55,280
Who are you?
- Call me the Third Eye of Politics.

1733
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:03,840
And what did the Third
Eye of Politics see?

1734
01:46:04,600 --> 01:46:07,400
That you passed the
fourth level, Ragini.

1735
01:46:07,680 --> 01:46:09,840
Welcome to the final level.

1736
01:46:10,120 --> 01:46:12,560
From here...you walk alone, Ragini.

1737
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:14,240
Walk alone.

1738
01:46:26,600 --> 01:46:30,480
We've discussed
all other witnesses.

1739
01:46:31,560 --> 01:46:34,320
Next application is Ragini Phule.

1740
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:38,880
The Committee has already discharged
her on the grounds of integrity...

1741
01:46:39,200 --> 01:46:40,720
...then how can you allow her?

1742
01:46:41,120 --> 01:46:43,000
That is her judicial right.

1743
01:46:43,520 --> 01:46:45,760
Then we should dismiss
her on ethical grounds.

1744
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:48,600
As a witness,
her integrity is under doubt.

1745
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:51,240
Then none of us should be here.

1746
01:46:52,840 --> 01:46:54,440
Why don't we let
the majority decide?

1747
01:46:55,320 --> 01:46:56,320
Fine...

1748
01:46:57,400 --> 01:46:59,840
Those against her, raise your hand.

1749
01:47:06,640 --> 01:47:09,240
Those in her favor,
raise your hand.

1750
01:47:16,080 --> 01:47:17,760
Ayesha, raise your hand.

1751
01:47:19,560 --> 01:47:20,680
Which one?

1752
01:47:21,640 --> 01:47:23,320
Left or right?
- What?

1753
01:47:23,480 --> 01:47:25,240
Your writing hand, Ms. Ayesha.

1754
01:47:30,680 --> 01:47:31,800
I abstain.

1755
01:47:35,080 --> 01:47:36,200
Okay.

1756
01:47:37,640 --> 01:47:38,720
3-3...

1757
01:47:39,280 --> 01:47:42,440
In such situations,
the chairman can exercise his vote.

1758
01:47:52,840 --> 01:47:53,840
In favor.

1759
01:47:56,440 --> 01:47:57,520
Sir...

1760
01:47:58,240 --> 01:48:00,000
Sir, how can you do such a thing?

1761
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:02,240
This is nothing
less than terrorism.

1762
01:48:10,320 --> 01:48:11,360
Right!

1763
01:48:13,160 --> 01:48:14,880
You're absolutely right.

1764
01:48:18,680 --> 01:48:20,240
I know, my friend.

1765
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:24,760
I know what a terrorist is.

1766
01:48:26,720 --> 01:48:32,800
What terrorist couldn't achieve
even after waging war for many years...

1767
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:38,240
...we did it without
even breaking into a sweat.

1768
01:48:44,440 --> 01:48:47,960
We've divided India.

1769
01:48:49,960 --> 01:48:54,040
India Somebodies, India Nobodies.

1770
01:48:54,800 --> 01:49:00,680
India Somebodies meaning we
handful of people who control it.

1771
01:49:01,960 --> 01:49:09,480
And India Nobodies
are the honest population of India.

1772
01:49:10,760 --> 01:49:12,000
And how did we do it?

1773
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:15,640
They have only one strength.
That is the truth.

1774
01:49:16,600 --> 01:49:19,760
And we snatched from them.

1775
01:49:20,760 --> 01:49:24,880
We took away their
right to raise their voice.

1776
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,800
We... We are political terrorists.

1777
01:49:36,360 --> 01:49:37,520
And you, Ms. Indira.

1778
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:45,320
You were supporting the cause so
you can negotiate with the government...

1779
01:49:45,680 --> 01:49:49,880
...and keep your NGOs
off the government's radar.

1780
01:49:51,360 --> 01:49:54,760
You have no sympathy for the truth.

1781
01:49:56,920 --> 01:49:59,600
You are a social terrorist.

1782
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:05,120
Your Honour.

1783
01:50:07,120 --> 01:50:12,880
You were supporting the cause to
stay in the government's good books.

1784
01:50:13,240 --> 01:50:15,240
You've no interest in the truth.

1785
01:50:15,640 --> 01:50:18,200
You only want your
position to stay intact.

1786
01:50:19,360 --> 01:50:22,120
You are a Judicial terrorist.

1787
01:50:26,200 --> 01:50:27,360
And you...

1788
01:50:27,600 --> 01:50:31,000
The government didn't
renew your term.

1789
01:50:32,080 --> 01:50:34,120
You have no apathy for the truth.

1790
01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:37,120
You're looking for revenge.

1791
01:50:38,200 --> 01:50:39,360
And you, Ms. Ayesha...

1792
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:42,680
Have you ever wondered,

1793
01:50:43,760 --> 01:50:45,120
if there's ever an inquiry...

1794
01:50:45,240 --> 01:50:46,960
...and new facts emerge,

1795
01:50:47,240 --> 01:50:50,200
then what about your book,
which is a best seller.

1796
01:50:50,840 --> 01:50:55,280
You've nothing to do with Mr.
Shashtri's life or death.

1797
01:50:55,720 --> 01:50:58,440
You just want the royalty.

1798
01:50:59,120 --> 01:51:00,280
Royalty.

1799
01:51:01,040 --> 01:51:03,960
You are an intellectual terrorist.

1800
01:51:06,760 --> 01:51:07,840
And the media...

1801
01:51:08,920 --> 01:51:11,200
Ragini is out to find the truth...

1802
01:51:12,280 --> 01:51:15,960
...but her editor doesn't
want to do anything with the truth.

1803
01:51:16,160 --> 01:51:19,400
They just care about their TRP.

1804
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,800
This is called TRP terrorism.

1805
01:51:25,240 --> 01:51:26,280
And you...

1806
01:51:27,120 --> 01:51:28,440
Ganga sir...

1807
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:36,080
You want an inquiry because
the cook's name was Jaan Mohammad.

1808
01:51:36,720 --> 01:51:37,680
Yes...

1809
01:51:39,360 --> 01:51:40,960
You're a racist.

1810
01:51:42,120 --> 01:51:44,920
More dangerous than a terrorist.

1811
01:51:47,560 --> 01:51:49,920
A dirty, lowlife.

1812
01:51:55,840 --> 01:51:56,760
And you...

1813
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,680
You have no truth of your own.

1814
01:52:03,640 --> 01:52:08,440
You don't care who's doing what.

1815
01:52:08,960 --> 01:52:11,000
As long as you keep benefitting.

1816
01:52:12,240 --> 01:52:19,760
All of us don't want to think
beyond our own personal interest.

1817
01:52:21,480 --> 01:52:27,520
Because we think that
democracy runs on votes.

1818
01:52:28,360 --> 01:52:30,160
No.

1819
01:52:30,480 --> 01:52:34,280
Democracy is runs on
ideologies and intelligence...

1820
01:52:35,080 --> 01:52:36,840
...which this Ragini has.

1821
01:52:37,800 --> 01:52:39,400
And so does today's youth.

1822
01:52:46,240 --> 01:52:48,720
Till now we spoke...

1823
01:52:53,080 --> 01:52:57,920
But now Ragini will speak,
the youth will speak.

1824
01:53:06,880 --> 01:53:09,120
The press will be present
at tomorrow session.

1825
01:53:09,240 --> 01:53:10,080
Yes, sir.

1826
01:53:10,160 --> 01:53:14,200
We have no right to hide
anything in a democracy.

1827
01:53:15,960 --> 01:53:17,280
Jai Hind.

1828
01:53:34,400 --> 01:53:36,480
Sir, I have Ragini's...

1829
01:53:36,640 --> 01:53:39,080
Till now we spoke...

1830
01:53:43,520 --> 01:53:48,200
But now Ragini will speak,
the youth will speak.

1831
01:53:51,120 --> 01:53:55,840
She was right we can forget
the past, but not run from it.

1832
01:53:56,840 --> 01:53:59,440
Someday you come
face to face with it.

1833
01:54:02,440 --> 01:54:05,200
Like it's happening now.
That's justice.

1834
01:54:06,440 --> 01:54:07,920
Exactly like my script.

1835
01:54:10,240 --> 01:54:16,040
Tripathi's sinking career
will get its brief glory.

1836
01:54:16,680 --> 01:54:21,120
Ragini will think that
truth has triumphed in this war.

1837
01:54:22,640 --> 01:54:24,720
My leadership will
lose the next election.

1838
01:54:24,960 --> 01:54:27,120
People will think
they gave a fitting reply

1839
01:54:27,240 --> 01:54:29,160
to my party for
concealing the truth.

1840
01:54:29,280 --> 01:54:31,680
And everyone will be reassured...

1841
01:54:31,840 --> 01:54:35,880
...that truth and justice
always prevail in the end.

1842
01:54:37,840 --> 01:54:40,040
But no one knows what the truth is.

1843
01:54:42,960 --> 01:54:47,800
No one knows who is the
creator of this entire script.

1844
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:57,000
Who says no one can
benefit from a dead PM?

1845
01:54:58,160 --> 01:54:59,360
Breaking news.

1846
01:54:59,480 --> 01:55:02,520
Aditya Raj has resigned
as the President of NUC...

1847
01:55:02,640 --> 01:55:08,640
...and rumors are rife that PKR Natrajan
is the strongest contender for the post.

1848
01:55:08,880 --> 01:55:10,280
Get to the goddamn point.

1849
01:55:11,080 --> 01:55:12,320
See this grave.

1850
01:55:13,720 --> 01:55:15,080
It belongs to Taimur Lung.

1851
01:55:15,440 --> 01:55:19,560
Taimur Lung knew that if
he wants to build his empire...

1852
01:55:19,680 --> 01:55:23,400
...then he will have to capture
the richest kingdom of his time.

1853
01:55:24,280 --> 01:55:26,040
And do you know which one was that?

1854
01:55:27,760 --> 01:55:28,920
Delhi.

1855
01:55:42,800 --> 01:55:45,600
Look. This is Delhi,
the heart of India.

1856
01:55:45,720 --> 01:55:48,000
And this is Lutyen's Delhi.

1857
01:55:48,480 --> 01:55:53,280
1.25 billion people of India struggle with
their problems, and poverty every day.

1858
01:55:53,440 --> 01:55:56,080
They put their sweat and blood
to continue being a part of Delhi's heart.

1859
01:55:56,360 --> 01:55:59,040
Now imagine,
if someone captures this heart...

1860
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:00,840
...the country will
still keep functioning,

1861
01:56:00,960 --> 01:56:03,880
but the heartbeat, the blood,
and ideology won't be ours.

1862
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:07,160
Capturing Lutyens Delhi
means capturing the entire country.

1863
01:56:07,320 --> 01:56:08,280
Come on...

1864
01:56:08,480 --> 01:56:13,960
What is the reason that when
a poor, honest leader comes here...

1865
01:56:14,280 --> 01:56:17,120
...all the veins of this
heart start to suffocate him.

1866
01:56:17,360 --> 01:56:18,840
Was Mr. Shashtri only mistake

1867
01:56:19,120 --> 01:56:22,840
that he didn't want anyone
to capture this heart?

1868
01:56:23,560 --> 01:56:24,680
Think.

1869
01:56:30,760 --> 01:56:34,040
Where Ragini Phule has
the support of the people...

1870
01:56:35,320 --> 01:56:36,720
...the president of 'Yuva Vahini'

1871
01:56:36,840 --> 01:56:40,520
has stated he won't let Ragini
Phule appear before the committee.

1872
01:56:41,840 --> 01:56:44,400
His party workers are
putting up roadblocks

1873
01:56:44,520 --> 01:56:47,520
so that Ragini Phule doesn't
appear before the Committee.

1874
01:56:50,400 --> 01:56:52,400
Back off!

1875
01:56:53,360 --> 01:56:54,800
Move back!

1876
01:56:58,160 --> 01:56:59,600
Presstitute.

1877
01:57:09,960 --> 01:57:14,040
"Anything goes."

1878
01:57:14,280 --> 01:57:17,920
"Truth is fair game."

1879
01:57:18,760 --> 01:57:23,200
"Truth is fair game."

1880
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:26,000
"Truth is fair game."

1881
01:57:28,200 --> 01:57:30,200
"Truth is fair game."

1882
01:57:31,840 --> 01:57:35,000
"Truth is fair game."

1883
01:57:41,920 --> 01:57:46,160
You may clean your face first.

1884
01:57:49,560 --> 01:57:50,680
Look Ms. Phule

1885
01:57:51,880 --> 01:57:56,720
you stated in your application
that you have new evidence.

1886
01:57:58,120 --> 01:57:59,840
We hope that you will

1887
01:58:00,840 --> 01:58:06,480
uphold the honor of this committee
and not present some fictional evidence.

1888
01:58:07,240 --> 01:58:09,360
And I even request the media...

1889
01:58:09,720 --> 01:58:12,720
...that even you must uphold
the honor of this committee.

1890
01:58:17,640 --> 01:58:18,840
Please begin.

1891
01:58:26,720 --> 01:58:28,720
Honorary members of the Committee,

1892
01:58:29,840 --> 01:58:31,000
thank you for allowing me.

1893
01:58:33,520 --> 01:58:37,760
Many theories relating to Lal Bahadur
Shastri's death are floating, right now.

1894
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:42,560
I don't know which is
the most popular theory of all...

1895
01:58:42,640 --> 01:58:47,800
...but I do know which
is the least popular one.

1896
01:58:50,240 --> 01:58:51,320
Truth.

1897
01:58:54,360 --> 01:58:55,440
The truth.

1898
01:59:00,240 --> 01:59:01,800
Many concerns were raised here.

1899
01:59:02,520 --> 01:59:08,560
But there is just one question which
is linked to all other questions.

1900
01:59:10,400 --> 01:59:11,400
Post Mortem.

1901
01:59:12,520 --> 01:59:14,920
Why wasn't a post mortem
ordered for Mr. Shashtri?

1902
01:59:15,440 --> 01:59:17,040
You've been told before.

1903
01:59:17,360 --> 01:59:20,040
There was no post mortem conducted
because of the lack of reasonable doubt.

1904
01:59:20,120 --> 01:59:21,240
And you're right!

1905
01:59:22,920 --> 01:59:27,760
We've been told that a post mortem is
only conducted when there's a suspicion.

1906
01:59:27,840 --> 01:59:29,200
When there's a strong
reason for doubt.

1907
01:59:29,280 --> 01:59:32,000
And there are no suspicions
in Mr. Shashtri's death.

1908
01:59:32,080 --> 01:59:34,480
There is no strong
reason for doubt.

1909
01:59:34,560 --> 01:59:37,840
I want to tell all of
you that we were lied to.

1910
01:59:37,920 --> 01:59:40,080
It was a state-sponsored lie.

1911
01:59:40,400 --> 01:59:42,120
This won't be recorded.

1912
01:59:48,640 --> 01:59:50,680
A few hours after Mr.
Shashtri's death...

1913
01:59:52,040 --> 01:59:55,720
...when his body was still in Tashkent,
then the 9th Director of KGB...

1914
01:59:56,080 --> 01:59:59,120
...arrested Russian butler
Ahmed Sattarov, his fellow cooks,

1915
01:59:59,440 --> 02:00:02,880
and Indian cook Jan Mohammad.

1916
02:00:03,600 --> 02:00:04,840
On what charges were they arrested?

1917
02:00:06,240 --> 02:00:10,080
They were arrested on the
charges of poisoning Mr. Shashtri.

1918
02:00:10,200 --> 02:00:15,240
Isn't this suspicion a strong reason
for doubt to carry out a post mortem?

1919
02:00:15,360 --> 02:00:17,920
But maybe it was
their secret mission...

1920
02:00:18,160 --> 02:00:20,120
...and our government
knows nothing about it.

1921
02:00:23,600 --> 02:00:25,040
Is it possible...

1922
02:00:26,040 --> 02:00:27,440
than an Indian cook...

1923
02:00:28,040 --> 02:00:30,760
An Indian Ambassador's
cook was arrested

1924
02:00:31,080 --> 02:00:33,680
on the charges of poisoning
our Prime Minister...

1925
02:00:34,240 --> 02:00:36,840
...and our government and
Intelligence doesn't know.

1926
02:00:37,160 --> 02:00:42,040
Maybe it was just
for routine questioning.

1927
02:00:42,120 --> 02:00:43,800
Then why only Jaan Mohammad?

1928
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:46,320
Why not Ramnath?

1929
02:00:46,760 --> 02:00:50,640
And ma'am you said that Kuldeep
Nayyar stated that there was no doubt.

1930
02:00:51,120 --> 02:00:52,120
Please pay attention to this.

1931
02:00:52,200 --> 02:00:57,840
See, TN Kaul was the Ambassador
during the Tashkent agreement.

1932
02:00:58,280 --> 02:01:01,680
And now when this issue
was raised here in the Parliament,

1933
02:01:01,760 --> 02:01:04,000
by Dharam Yashdev who raised it...

1934
02:01:04,360 --> 02:01:06,840
During that time, he was
the Foreign Secretary here.

1935
02:01:07,280 --> 02:01:10,440
So I was then the
State Press Executive

1936
02:01:10,520 --> 02:01:15,200
So he called me saying "Why don't you
give a statement and end this for good".

1937
02:01:15,720 --> 02:01:17,280
And I said I've no reason
to get into this now?

1938
02:01:17,360 --> 02:01:18,800
I am not longer the press...

1939
02:01:19,160 --> 02:01:21,120
But he kept badgering me.

1940
02:01:21,200 --> 02:01:23,920
And that's when I got suspicious.

1941
02:01:24,640 --> 02:01:28,720
Because he called
me over and over again.

1942
02:01:30,040 --> 02:01:33,160
I said this can be
one of the aspects too.

1943
02:01:33,640 --> 02:01:36,680
But, that must
have been...recently.

1944
02:01:36,760 --> 02:01:40,920
You also said that two British doctors,
Dr. Liam West, and Dr. Spyro said...

1945
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,800
...that the color blue is very
consistent with natural death.

1946
02:01:44,160 --> 02:01:46,240
The body turns blue
when it starts to decompose.

1947
02:01:46,320 --> 02:01:48,040
And that was selective reporting.

1948
02:01:48,120 --> 02:01:49,920
Because it was further
mentioned in that report...

1949
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:54,640
...that without a postmortem
report, and toxicological studies,

1950
02:01:54,720 --> 02:01:58,400
it is impossible to say
that Mr. Shashtri wasn't poisoned.

1951
02:01:59,080 --> 02:02:03,920
All these facts...were
concealed from us.

1952
02:02:04,480 --> 02:02:08,400
How can you say that the Government
intentionally hid facts from the people?

1953
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:13,280
You wanted proof.

1954
02:02:15,720 --> 02:02:19,840
If there were cuts on
Mr. Shashtri's body and there was blood...

1955
02:02:21,320 --> 02:02:23,160
...then it must have stained
his clothes as well.

1956
02:02:23,240 --> 02:02:24,800
Those clothes must
be with his family.

1957
02:02:32,240 --> 02:02:33,960
This is Mr. Shashtri's cap.

1958
02:02:34,120 --> 02:02:35,160
What?

1959
02:02:36,560 --> 02:02:37,760
Where did you get that from?

1960
02:02:37,880 --> 02:02:41,120
Given to me by his
grandson Sanjay Singh.

1961
02:02:48,680 --> 02:02:49,560
Show me.

1962
02:02:49,640 --> 02:02:51,440
Is this the cap he
was wearing that day?

1963
02:02:51,720 --> 02:02:52,720
Yes.

1964
02:03:02,120 --> 02:03:03,160
Your evidence?

1965
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:09,640
Are their blood stains.

1966
02:03:17,360 --> 02:03:20,560
All of you think for a minute...

1967
02:03:22,640 --> 02:03:28,080
One of your family member,
a relative...

1968
02:03:28,640 --> 02:03:30,800
...who travels outside the country.

1969
02:03:31,680 --> 02:03:33,800
And suddenly dies on foreign soil.

1970
02:03:34,280 --> 02:03:36,520
And you're told
it's a natural death.

1971
02:03:36,960 --> 02:03:38,120
Heart attack.

1972
02:03:38,800 --> 02:03:42,240
But when you receive
the dead body...

1973
02:03:42,680 --> 02:03:46,200
...it has completely swelled
up and turned black.

1974
02:03:46,880 --> 02:03:50,200
There are numerous cuts
on the body and also bleeding.

1975
02:03:50,960 --> 02:03:56,840
As a family member, do you have
no right to conduct a postmortem?

1976
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:06,880
Isn't it true, back in those days
the KGB would extract the organs...

1977
02:04:06,960 --> 02:04:09,040
...so that there's no
trace of poison left behind?

1978
02:04:15,480 --> 02:04:17,240
Did Mr. Shashtri
suffer the same fate?

1979
02:04:19,080 --> 02:04:22,560
Is that why he had
so many cuts on his body?

1980
02:04:25,280 --> 02:04:26,320
Okay.

1981
02:04:27,280 --> 02:04:29,160
Let's talk about motives now.

1982
02:04:31,280 --> 02:04:35,600
Within the next 10 years of Shashtri sir's
death, India was colonized again.

1983
02:04:35,680 --> 02:04:36,760
Yes...

1984
02:04:37,360 --> 02:04:39,280
India became a colony again.

1985
02:04:39,800 --> 02:04:41,600
How?
Let me tell you.

1986
02:04:41,800 --> 02:04:45,560
By using our own constitutions,
our politicians,

1987
02:04:45,640 --> 02:04:49,880
our media,
our intellectuals, our systems...

1988
02:04:50,280 --> 02:04:52,920
...India became a colony again.

1989
02:04:55,200 --> 02:04:58,440
Would it still be possible
if Mr. Shashtri had been alive?

1990
02:05:01,280 --> 02:05:03,480
And on whose orders was it done?

1991
02:05:04,360 --> 02:05:06,080
What childishness is this?

1992
02:05:14,680 --> 02:05:16,600
This is the
Constitution of India...

1993
02:05:17,120 --> 02:05:19,040
...and not the manifesto
of some Political party.

1994
02:05:19,600 --> 02:05:23,320
Socialism can be the policy
of some party, but not the country.

1995
02:05:24,120 --> 02:05:28,400
Using the word 'Socialism' in our
constitution is murdering democracy.

1996
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:30,320
We don't need your opinion.

1997
02:05:30,440 --> 02:05:31,800
And this is not my opinion.

1998
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:35,080
I didn't say this...

1999
02:05:37,520 --> 02:05:40,240
These are the words of the
man who wrote this constitution.

2000
02:05:40,960 --> 02:05:42,720
Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar.

2001
02:05:45,800 --> 02:05:48,360
But within 10 years
of Shastri sir's death...

2002
02:05:48,720 --> 02:05:52,120
...this constitution by Babasaheb,

2003
02:05:52,600 --> 02:05:55,120
the very definition of our country,
was changed.

2004
02:05:57,320 --> 02:05:59,920
The word Socialism
was added here...

2005
02:06:00,120 --> 02:06:03,760
Why was our Democracy murdered?

2006
02:06:04,160 --> 02:06:07,280
Sir, this can't go on record.
Please have this deleted.

2007
02:06:09,280 --> 02:06:11,560
And from how many records
are you going to delete it, Rana?

2008
02:06:17,680 --> 02:06:21,640
And all these changes were imbibed
when all the socialist leaders

2009
02:06:21,840 --> 02:06:23,560
of our country,
our thinkers, writers...

2010
02:06:24,080 --> 02:06:26,680
...intellectual beings,
journalists, were in jail.

2011
02:06:27,040 --> 02:06:29,040
This is a lie...
- I...

2012
02:06:32,440 --> 02:06:34,080
I was one of them.

2013
02:06:37,080 --> 02:06:41,240
Democracy was murdered
during Emergency.

2014
02:06:44,360 --> 02:06:45,440
You...

2015
02:06:46,640 --> 02:06:49,200
You should accept that now.

2016
02:06:50,240 --> 02:06:51,360
Right?

2017
02:06:53,400 --> 02:06:54,400
The question is

2018
02:06:54,480 --> 02:06:57,920
who had an opportunity to benefit
most from Mr. Shashtri's death...

2019
02:06:58,040 --> 02:07:01,960
...by murdering our democracy,
and changing our constitution?

2020
02:07:02,600 --> 02:07:07,920
Who wanted our country to sink our knee
deep in the ideology of Socialism?

2021
02:07:12,080 --> 02:07:13,640
Sir, the clues of murder

2022
02:07:13,720 --> 02:07:18,040
are found in the events that follow
after the murder and not before it.

2023
02:07:19,960 --> 02:07:20,920
This book...

2024
02:07:22,800 --> 02:07:24,000
This book...

2025
02:07:26,440 --> 02:07:27,760
The Mitrokhin Archive...

2026
02:07:28,120 --> 02:07:31,000
written by Vassili
Nikitich Mitrokhin.

2027
02:07:31,080 --> 02:07:33,000
He was the KGB's
director of Archives.

2028
02:07:33,160 --> 02:07:35,440
When the USSR split in 1992,

2029
02:07:35,520 --> 02:07:40,680
Mitrokhin gave 25,000 secret
documents to Britain.

2030
02:07:40,760 --> 02:07:44,680
After which there as a Mitrokhin
Commission formed in Britain and Italy.

2031
02:07:45,360 --> 02:07:50,400
And there were cases filed against
all corrupt politicians and leaders.

2032
02:07:50,520 --> 02:07:53,160
There's another
chapter in this book...

2033
02:07:54,560 --> 02:07:56,160
which is about India.

2034
02:08:05,560 --> 02:08:08,520
Why?
Why wasn't this brought in?

2035
02:08:08,960 --> 02:08:12,560
But we...don't know
anything about it.

2036
02:08:13,080 --> 02:08:16,680
Mitrokhin Report is considered the world's
best counter-intelligence report...

2037
02:08:16,760 --> 02:08:20,160
...but in India... suppress it.

2038
02:08:20,240 --> 02:08:22,640
Sweep everything under the carpet.

2039
02:08:22,840 --> 02:08:24,840
Mitrokhin Archives Volume 2...

2040
02:08:25,760 --> 02:08:28,040
Former KGB Major General
Oleg Kalugin said...

2041
02:08:28,160 --> 02:08:31,320
...it seemed like the
entire country was for sale.

2042
02:08:32,920 --> 02:08:34,200
India was for sale.

2043
02:08:36,240 --> 02:08:41,280
If Shashtri sir was still alive...
would India still be for sale?

2044
02:08:41,920 --> 02:08:44,880
Is this why Shashtri
sir was poisoned in Tashkent?

2045
02:08:44,960 --> 02:08:47,680
Is this why there were cuts on Mr.
Shashtri's body?

2046
02:08:47,760 --> 02:08:50,040
Is this why there was
no postmortem conducted?

2047
02:08:50,120 --> 02:08:53,680
Who put a for sale sign
on the forehead of India?

2048
02:08:53,760 --> 02:08:56,280
I request you, sir.
please stop this girl.

2049
02:08:57,280 --> 02:08:58,920
What childishness is this?

2050
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,640
Few days in the media, and you
want to defame your own country.

2051
02:09:02,720 --> 02:09:03,640
What the hell do you know?

2052
02:09:04,280 --> 02:09:05,200
These people are right...

2053
02:09:05,280 --> 02:09:07,160
They are all right,
you are an anti-national.

2054
02:09:07,240 --> 02:09:08,720
Let her speak!

2055
02:09:09,320 --> 02:09:10,440
Child's play.

2056
02:09:13,360 --> 02:09:14,960
I want to tell you,

2057
02:09:15,360 --> 02:09:17,120
in the 1970's

2058
02:09:18,880 --> 02:09:20,840
India had a status...

2059
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:22,960
...it was Disneyland for spies.

2060
02:09:23,480 --> 02:09:25,600
Disneyland meaning amusement park.

2061
02:09:26,240 --> 02:09:30,800
KGB had more spies in
India than around the world.

2062
02:09:31,520 --> 02:09:35,400
Around 21 political leaders,
out of which four were Ministers...

2063
02:09:35,720 --> 02:09:37,800
...and there's something
I want to read.

2064
02:09:40,160 --> 02:09:43,120
A top leader,
Codename VANO, V A N O...

2065
02:09:43,200 --> 02:09:45,320
...was sent suitcases
of money by the KGB.

2066
02:09:45,400 --> 02:09:47,920
On one occasion
a secret gift of 2 million

2067
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,400
was personally delivered
by the KGB head in India.

2068
02:09:50,480 --> 02:09:53,040
Another million rupees were
given on the same occasion to

2069
02:09:53,120 --> 02:09:55,680
a newspaper supporting
the top leader.

2070
02:09:55,760 --> 02:09:59,240
In 1978, the KGB was running
over 300 agents in India.

2071
02:09:59,320 --> 02:10:00,600
The biggest number in the world.

2072
02:10:02,080 --> 02:10:04,800
It's all available in this book,
for you to read.

2073
02:10:09,760 --> 02:10:13,520
Is selling the security
of our country nationalism?

2074
02:10:17,800 --> 02:10:22,040
During the 1970s, within
10 years of Shashtri sir's death...

2075
02:10:22,360 --> 02:10:26,000
...media, journalists,
politicians, intellectuals,

2076
02:10:26,200 --> 02:10:30,400
historians,
scientists, professors, security...

2077
02:10:30,640 --> 02:10:33,440
...were on the payroll of the KGB.

2078
02:10:34,240 --> 02:10:35,520
This is Nationalism?

2079
02:10:40,760 --> 02:10:43,480
And this is not taught to us in
school, college, or anywhere else.

2080
02:10:43,720 --> 02:10:48,160
Nobody knows this because
no one records these in history.

2081
02:10:50,200 --> 02:10:52,880
is writing wrong
history nationalism?

2082
02:10:54,320 --> 02:10:58,320
Everyone's objecting claiming
that I am too young, immature...

2083
02:10:59,040 --> 02:11:00,240
just a school girl.

2084
02:11:00,600 --> 02:11:02,560
Presstitute. Antinational.

2085
02:11:03,240 --> 02:11:07,320
But sir, I am a hardworking,
tax-paying youth of this country.

2086
02:11:08,760 --> 02:11:09,920
And I am proud...

2087
02:11:10,280 --> 02:11:11,880
The truth, facts,

2088
02:11:11,960 --> 02:11:15,640
that these intellectuals, historians
suppressed over the last 50 years,

2089
02:11:16,160 --> 02:11:17,800
lied to us...

2090
02:11:18,440 --> 02:11:23,360
...was raised again by me,
a young citizen of India.

2091
02:11:25,720 --> 02:11:29,640
One after the other, everything is
pointing towards only one thing...

2092
02:11:29,720 --> 02:11:34,200
...but we didn't look at it because
of our prejudices, and agendas.

2093
02:11:39,040 --> 02:11:44,320
If you believe that a citizen's
first right within a democracy...

2094
02:11:44,600 --> 02:11:45,800
...is to know the truth.

2095
02:11:45,880 --> 02:11:47,960
The right to know the truth.

2096
02:11:49,640 --> 02:11:52,920
Then you find out
what the truth is now.

2097
02:11:56,600 --> 02:11:57,720
And that will be

2098
02:11:59,320 --> 02:12:01,520
the right way to pay
our respects to late

2099
02:12:01,600 --> 02:12:04,840
Nationalist Prime Minister
Lal Bahadur Shashtri.

2100
02:12:04,920 --> 02:12:06,560
Real Justice.

2101
02:12:08,240 --> 02:12:10,400
And that sir will be nationalism.

2102
02:12:16,360 --> 02:12:17,480
That's all, sir.

2103
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:11,280
Tripathi, sir.

2104
02:13:12,280 --> 02:13:13,440
Tripathi, sir.

2105
02:13:17,440 --> 02:13:19,320
Did I pass the fifth level?

2106
02:13:21,600 --> 02:13:23,000
What did you gain from all this?

2107
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:27,120
Topic.

2108
02:13:28,360 --> 02:13:33,240
A sensational topic for
the next Parliament Election.

2109
02:13:33,560 --> 02:13:39,920
Meaning you're least interested
in Mr. Shashtri and the truth.

2110
02:13:40,960 --> 02:13:42,520
Winning is everything.

2111
02:13:46,720 --> 02:13:49,800
Winning is crucial in Politics.

2112
02:13:51,640 --> 02:13:56,440
Because losers can never
change the fate of the country.

2113
02:14:00,840 --> 02:14:02,000
By the way...

2114
02:14:06,400 --> 02:14:08,040
Welcome to Politics.
